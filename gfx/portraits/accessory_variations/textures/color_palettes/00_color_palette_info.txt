# Color Palettes are used to add colors to a specific piece of clothing. They consist of columns that are at least 4 Pixels wide. Each Pixel can take a color. If you add more than 1 coloumn, the game will choose one of them randomly.
# If the coloumn is longer than 4 pixels, it has multiple parts for the texture. E.g. a shirt and a collar, etc.

# Make sure to safe the color_palette in the right format RGB8.
