What if the Basileía Romaíon (Roman Empire in Medieval Greek) never ended in the east? always retaining Anatolia and Greece and slowly regaining limited control over the Balkans, Levant, Egypt and north eastern Africa? What if the Romaíoi (Greek speaking eastern Romans) continued to influence the course of events throughout Europa, Asia, Africa and the New World?

As Basileus Augustinos Palaiologos you control directly or indirectly roughly the same borders as the Basileía Romaíon had by end of the Macedonian Restoration right before the battle at Manzikert. In this timeline divergence, that event went differently and in the proceeding history Basileía Romaíon regained the Levant, Aegypt and North Africa, recent events has had those regions breakaway from Konstantinopolis. Despite starting in a good spot this mod is not meant to be easy. Goal is for a challenging and rewarding play-though. Vassals should and will rebel if not appeased, minorities will agitate and rise up if not given rights and your neighbors will plot your downfall.
