[h1]Basileía Romaíon[/h1]

What if the Basileía Romaíon (Roman Empire in Medieval Greek) never ended in the east? always retaining Anatolia and Greece and slowly regaining control over the Balkans, Levant, Egypt and North Africa? What if the Romaíoi (Greek speaking eastern Romans) continued to influence the course of events throughout Europa, Asia, Africa and the New World?

As Basileus Augustinos Palaiologos you control directly or indirectly roughly the same borders as the Basileía Romaíon had by end of the Macedonian Restoration right before the battle at Manzikert. In this timeline divergence, that event went differently and in the proceeding history Basileía Romaíon regained the Levant, Aegypt, North Africa and whose colonists founded the colony of Elysium in the new world, recent events has had those regions breakaway from Konstantinopolis. Despite starting in a good spot this mod is not meant to be easy. Goal is for a challenging and rewarding play-though. Vassals should and will rebel if not appeased, minorities will agitate and rise up if not given rights and your neighbors will plot your downfall.

I am not a native Greek speaker. The names I use for every thing are inspired by Medieval Byzantine Greek some items I had to use Google translate for and then try and change the word pattern to how i think it would of been spelled in Medieval Greek. (If Medieval Greek used the Latin Alphabet. ) as such I am trying my best to make a mod I find fun and immersive.

Mod content currently only in English Localization, if any one wants to help translate into their native language that would be awesome.
