[h1]Basileía Romaíon 1736 [/h1] [b] ERE, Eastern Roman Empire, Byzantium or Byzantine Empire Alternative History Mod.[/b]

What if the Basileía Romaíon (Roman Empire in Medieval Greek) never ended in the east? always retaining Anatolia and Greece and slowly regaining control over the Balkans, Levant, Egypt and North Africa? What if the Romaíoi (Greek speaking eastern Romans) continued to influence the course of events throughout Europa, Asia, Africa and the New World?
