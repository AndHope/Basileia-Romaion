0.10 "Under the Tatar Yoke"
This update is inspired by a period of russian history termed "Under the Tatar Yoke"
"Having joined Central Asia, China, Khoresm and Transcaucasia to his empire, Genghis Khan aimed for Russian lands. In 1223 the armies of Genghis Khan defeated Russians on the River Kalka. After the battle Tatars devastated the towns in the outskirts of Chernigov but soon retreated to the Volga steppes. In the late 1237 the union of Mongolian tribes, the Golden Horde, headed by Batu (1208 – 1255), the grandson of Genghis Khan, invaded Ryazan. Afterwards Mongols conquered Moscow and moved to Vladimir. In February 1238 Vladimir was besieged and taken by storm. Novgorod was left unprotected. But Tatars were exhausted and they returned to the steppe. In autumn 1239 Batu resumed his attacks. Now his aim was to conquer southern principalities. The first to fall was Chernigov. In a year’s time Batu’s armies approached Kiev’s walls. After lasting siege and fierce fight Kiev was taken. That period marked the beginning of Tatar Yoke. Russian lands were devastated. The citizens were annihilated or enslaved. Most of the ruined cities never rose again. Russian knayzes accepted the superior power of the Khan and agreed to pay tribute (yasak) to the conquerors. They also had to ask for new Russian rulers appointment approval. Russian knyazes strove to get rid of vassal dependence on the Golden Horde. However, they were not strong enough to fight."

Scramble for the New World - Ver.0.8
0.8 New World Update.
- Completely revamps the new world based on the alternative history world this mod takes place in.
	- This includes many new indgenious nations, including two large empires based on the Aztec and Inca Empires. (Note I have tried to use the names the orginal inhabitants called themselves whenever possible) If I have any native tribs in the incorrect location etc please let me know on discord forums or on here and I will try to correct it.
	- New World Religions including Totemism, Nahuatl, Inti and Mesoamerican.
	- New World Colonial cultures.
	- Romaíoi settlers founded Elysium in the new world though as a consequence of being separated and often blockaded by the various latin powers in control of the straits of Heracles Elysium has really gone it's own way. Finding similarities between the local deities and Hellenic Deities of the past the Elysians have mostly embraced the old Hellenic ways and integrated with the local natives really creating a very unique culture.
	- Vinland was founded by Norse settlers whom rejected the Abrahamic God instead holding true to the Gods of their ancestors.
	- New Decisions, Elysium can decide to convert back to Orthadoxy and or then switch back to Hellenic (This event causing most people of the relgion your switching from to become radical and the religion your switching to become loyalist.) and other large temporary maluses. A new hidden decision available to Basileía Romaíon.
	- Fixed it so all new Government and Ruler title are working as intended. Thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895012465
	- Many fixes and tweaks.

Update 0.4 Al-Andalus Update.
- Added new nations in Iberia with new flags, cultures, characters and more including Al-Andalus, Asturias, Aragon and Navara.

Added in the Holy Roman Empire. This is only my first pass on the region I wanted something that was functional and Fun in the future will spend more time creating a more unique HRE set up.
