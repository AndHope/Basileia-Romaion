0.32

- Aegypt and North Africa
	- Added in the Klysma (Suez) Canal into the game at start. In order to make trade correctly flow though the red sea towards Aegypt instead of going all the way around africa. Think of it as the more modern version of Pharohs Canal or even just the basic trade unloading in Pelosion then travaling by road and reloading in Klysma. Did some other canal changes based on the various canal mods to make it profitable.

- HRE changes
	- New vassals Burgundy, Flanders, Franconia and Swabia.

	- Added colonial and other expansion wars at game start.
	- DEI, EET, Oman and Lan are all rivals with each other at game start as their battle it out for trade in the indian ocean and beyond.

- New Mughal Culture they are a iranian/central asian culture that rules over their indian empire. Currently make up less than a percent of Mughalstan but control 75% of the power.

Well in 1.2 the AI is now obsessed with downsizing ports in their capitals and dispite weeks of trying to prevent it I coulden't get the ai to stop which caused issues with immersion with these great ports turning into minor anchorages. So I introduced new Momument "Great Port" in Genoa, Venice and Konstantinople it is equivilent to a level 5 port with some extra bonuses.

0.10 "Under the Tatar Yoke"
This update is inspired by a period of russian history termed "Under the Tatar Yoke"
"Having joined Central Asia, China, Khoresm and Transcaucasia to his empire, Genghis Khan aimed for Russian lands. In 1223 the armies of Genghis Khan defeated Russians on the River Kalka. After the battle Tatars devastated the towns in the outskirts of Chernigov but soon retreated to the Volga steppes. In the late 1237 the union of Mongolian tribes, the Golden Horde, headed by Batu (1208 – 1255), the grandson of Genghis Khan, invaded Ryazan. Afterwards Mongols conquered Moscow and moved to Vladimir. In February 1238 Vladimir was besieged and taken by storm. Novgorod was left unprotected. But Tatars were exhausted and they returned to the steppe. In autumn 1239 Batu resumed his attacks. Now his aim was to conquer southern principalities. The first to fall was Chernigov. In a year’s time Batu’s armies approached Kiev’s walls. After lasting siege and fierce fight Kiev was taken. That period marked the beginning of Tatar Yoke. Russian lands were devastated. The citizens were annihilated or enslaved. Most of the ruined cities never rose again. Russian knayzes accepted the superior power of the Khan and agreed to pay tribute (yasak) to the conquerors. They also had to ask for new Russian rulers appointment approval. Russian knyazes strove to get rid of vassal dependence on the Golden Horde. However, they were not strong enough to fight."

Mod already has less overall pops than the base game due to the Americas starting with 1/20th the population of base game but by consolidating these similar cultures it will greatly improve late game performance further. May split them off again later on.


Scramble for the New World - Ver.0.8
0.8 New World Update.
- Completely revamps the new world based on the alternative history world this mod takes place in.
	- This includes many new indgenious nations, including two large empires based on the Aztec and Inca Empires. (Note I have tried to use the names the orginal inhabitants called themselves whenever possible) If I have any native tribs in the incorrect location etc please let me know on discord forums or on here and I will try to correct it.
	- New World Religions including Totemism, Nahuatl, Inti and Mesoamerican.
	- New World Colonial cultures.
	- Romaíoi settlers founded Elysium in the new world though as a consequence of being separated and often blockaded by the various latin powers in control of the straits of Heracles Elysium has really gone it's own way. Finding similarities between the local deities and Hellenic Deities of the past the Elysians have mostly embraced the old Hellenic ways and integrated with the local natives really creating a very unique culture.
	- Vinland was founded by Norse settlers whom rejected the Abrahamic God instead holding true to the Gods of their ancestors.
	- New Decisions, Elysium can decide to convert back to Orthadoxy and or then switch back to Hellenic (This event causing most people of the relgion your switching from to become radical and the religion your switching to become loyalist.) and other large temporary maluses. A new hidden decision available to Basileía Romaíon.
	- Fixed it so all new Government and Ruler title are working as intended. Thanks to https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2895012465
	- Many fixes and tweaks.

0.7 Update. Mali Empire update.
- Adds a new diplomatic AI. Aggressive expanion, This AI is over twice as aggressive as Territorial Expansion. Persia and Abbasid start with it and nations have a chance to get it thoughout the game based on similar factors as Territorial expansion.
- Further further restirctions on Italy forming. Increased the tech required for the journal entry to Mass_Propaganda, made it so you can only absorb puppets not custom union members and forming Italy only absorbs North Italians not South Italians.
- Adds the Mali Empire.
- Adds the Adal Sultanate
- Improved Abbasid starting buildings and trade they now have access to guns and cannons and Hedjez has Line Infantry and Cannons. Every where else still irregular infantry no cannons you'll need to import more weapons to switch all over. Should make the starting war easier though.
- Splits off Zanzibar from Abbasid they are a vassal of Abbasid ruled over by a upper class of Arabs.
- Removes Andalusian Control of Mozambique and Angola and gave control to local decentralized nations.
- Improved Persian starting trade.
- Improved Basileía Romaíon starting Trade.

- Fixes bug that prevented you from returning to Themata primacy if you switched to Tagmata Primacy.


0.6 update Abbasid Caliphate.
- Arabia has recently reunited under a new ambitious Abbasid Caliph in Mecca detirmined to reclaim the rightful lands of the Caliph from the infidel. Abbasids should be a fun nation to play as or against.
- Adds Themata and Tagmata primacy modifiers and decisions to switch between the two.
- Adds an Eastern Armenian nation named Arevelyan as a vassal of Persia. (Name means Eastern in Armenian). Might nativize more names in the future.

- Renamed all the IGs of Basileía Romaíon to better reflect their historical names and adjusted their politics.
- Further restictions on Italy forming.
- Pontikoí renamed to Pontíoi. Turns out that Pontikoí means "little mice" in Greek whoops! :S

- Austria is now more likely to annex Prussia when forming HRE.
- Austria and HRE have claims to Northern Italy, Belgium, Holstein and Alsace Loraine.
- Venice and Genoa now use their CK3 colors.
- Atlantide no longer a Subject of Venice, it didn't make sense with Al-Andalus controlling both sides of the straits.
- Atlantide starts off in a war of Survival against Al-Andalus. During my observe games Atlantide wins the war against the Andalusian AI about 50% of the time though I imagine an Andalusian player would win easily.

Update 0.4 Al-Andalus Update.
- Added new nations in Iberia with new flags, cultures, characters and more including Al-Andalus, Asturias, Aragon and Navara.
- Started work on the new world by adding New Granada as a colonial subject of Al-Andalus and Atlantide as a colonial subject of Venice. Many other temporary changes, next update will be a major overhaul of south america.

Version alpha 0.3.0 HRE & Merchant Republic Update

- Can now centralize the HRE into a singular nation (This replaces the form Germany).

- Basileía Romaíon Ruler now properly displays the title of Basileus or Basilissa.
- Merchant Republics now have the correct name for their Government which is "Merchant Republic" and ruled by a Doge.
- Subjects of Basileía Romaíon now properly have the government form Exarchate and are ruled by a Exarchos
- Basileía Romaíon now has a custom ruler which I made by just blindly meshing random genes together but I like how it turned out Long Live Basileus Augustinos Palaiologos our Roman SteamPunk Emperor!
- Fixed dozens of bugs and other random stuff.

Current version Phase three Alpha 0.2.2 ( Holy Roman & Merchant Republic Update)

Added in the Holy Roman Empire. This is only my first pass on the region I wanted something that was functional and Fun in the future will spend more time creating a more unique HRE set up.
