	- added New Religion 'Elysian Orthodox' and decision for Elysium to return to it. Years of religious conflict within Elysium between the Neo Hellenes and Elysian Orthdox similar to the 30 years war in our timeline have rocked the colony since its independence.

	- Gave Louisiana a tiny foothold in Arkansas for similar reasons.

- Aegypt and North Africa
	- Added in the Klysma (Suez) Canal into the game at start. In order to make trade correctly flow though the red sea towards Aegypt instead of going all the way around Afrika.

Their AI will work to consolidate by annexing these vassals then move on to further subjugate their surroundings but this makes them a tad weaker early on but still a big blue blob end game boss to overcome if your playing one of their neighbors.

- I am getting closer to isolating/fixing the lens CTD, believe its related to the States and or a file dependant on the states file. 
	- Currently is mostly only affects europe and more so at start of game. Current Workaround is to avoid the building construction lens especially zooming in and out while on the lens and building via other paths until a year into the game then the lens system should function fine.

- New Mughal Culture they are a iranian/central asian culture that rules over their indian empire. Currently make up less than a percent of Mughalstan but control 75% of the power.

0.10 "Under the Tatar Yoke"
This update is inspired by a period of russian history termed "Under the Tatar Yoke"
"Having joined Central Asia, China, Khoresm and Transcaucasia to his empire, Genghis Khan aimed for Russian lands. In 1223 the armies of Genghis Khan defeated Russians on the River Kalka. After the battle Tatars devastated the towns in the outskirts of Chernigov but soon retreated to the Volga steppes. In the late 1237 the union of Mongolian tribes, the Golden Horde, headed by Batu (1208 – 1255), the grandson of Genghis Khan, invaded Ryazan. Afterwards Mongols conquered Moscow and moved to Vladimir. In February 1238 Vladimir was besieged and taken by storm. Novgorod was left unprotected. But Tatars were exhausted and they returned to the steppe. In autumn 1239 Batu resumed his attacks. Now his aim was to conquer southern principalities. The first to fall was Chernigov. In a year’s time Batu’s armies approached Kiev’s walls. After lasting siege and fierce fight Kiev was taken. That period marked the beginning of Tatar Yoke. Russian lands were devastated. The citizens were annihilated or enslaved. Most of the ruined cities never rose again. Russian knayzes accepted the superior power of the Khan and agreed to pay tribute (yasak) to the conquerors. They also had to ask for new Russian rulers appointment approval. Russian knyazes strove to get rid of vassal dependence on the Golden Horde. However, they were not strong enough to fight."

Scramble for the New World - Ver.0.8
0.8 New World Update.
- Completely revamps the new world based on the alternative history world this mod takes place in.
	- This includes many new indgenious nations, including two large empires based on the Aztec and Inca Empires.

	- New World Religions including Totemism, Nahuatl, Inti and Mesoamerican.
	- New World Colonial cultures.
	- Romaíoi settlers founded Elysium in the new world though as a consequence of being separated and often blockaded by the various latin powers in control of the straits of Heracles Elysium has really gone it's own way. Finding similarities between the local deities and Hellenic Deities of the past the Elysians have mostly embraced the old Hellenic ways and integrated with the local natives really creating a very unique culture.
	- Vinland was founded by Norse settlers whom rejected the Abrahamic God instead holding true to the Gods of their ancestors.

A new hidden decision available to Basileía Romaíon.

Update 0.4 Al-Andalus Update.
- Added new nations in Iberia with new flags, cultures, characters and more including Al-Andalus, Asturias, Aragon and Navara.
