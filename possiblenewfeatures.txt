Europe;
- HRE;
	- HRE Liberalization and possible HRE turning into Revolutionary France then French Empire possible Napoléon?
		- So far added a decision the player can take once wealth_voting is passed that gives you Napoléon as ruler and a more progressive Monarchy. Plan to add flavor and events eventually.
	- Possibly break up the HRE into more smaller vassals possibly protectorates or a new vassal type.
	- Add a HRE Dismantle event similar to the Chinese Warlords

- ERE;	
	- Flavor events maybe fun ones like CK2 had Hippodrome chariot racing black sea pirates etc.
	- Set up decisions to set up Patriarchs as you reconquer Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome
	- Senate events
	- Tie the noble revolts to happen during the reform process
	- Theodosian walls... Province defense buff?	

- Great Briton	
	- Possibly replace Great Briton with Danelaw inspired nation.

Asia;	
- Golden Horde
	- More flavor
	- Russian revolt / Rise of Muscovy
	- More conflict with Commonwealth as well as attempt to annex Vlach Exarchates as well as the Causcases
	
- China;
	- More events and decisions to create more conflict between Ming and Yuan.


New World;
	- More flavor for Elysium and Vineland.
	- Move away from having Europeans directly control territory and instead have Colonial subjects
