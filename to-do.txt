###TODO
updated 9/7/24

	###Organization
		- reogranize modifiers by catagory/type instead of country. 

	###Balance

	- Continue tech balance
		- add more diversity to tech pictures
		- make sure all techs have an effect; either buff or building unlock.
		- create more production methods instead of buffs (Do last because it will likely require most time balancing.)
		- add effect to distillation tech


	###Content

	#HRE
	- Some sort of Journal explaining the situation and the semi feudal system they start with.
	- Give them optional paths liberalize path and autocratic path similar to the PLC content.
		- Rise of Napoleon type figure.
		- Journal entry to encourage them to annex their vassals ( I can make their AI more aggressive to certain tags cultures etc when they have certain JEs. recently added this to the ERE hence why its way better at regaining its breakaway regions.)

		- Create unqiue mechanics for HRE power bloc.
			- Goal would be to make a way to have it replace the vassal with indepdent countries that could not leave the power bloc at least not the way it currently works.

		- More unique flags for countries based on government type.
		- More unique names for countries based on government type
		- Add modifiers to Bohemia, Hussite legacy or something

	#ERE
		- Improve ERE journal interface with newer features
		- 
	#Elysium

		-

	#Saxony
		- Replace Sorbs with Wends? 
		- Add more content
			- Event on their eastern expansion and subjugation of the Wends (Historically was during the crusades but those were not really a thing in the mod so would of been more gradually)

	###Map work

		- Work on breaking up Indonesia/Malaysia a bit more

		- Rework central african borders
			- Sokoto area more broken up
			- replace zulu and other countries that did not actually exist that early
		
	####Events
		- events related to the east/west (EREvsHRE) imperial rivalry and the schisms.
		- Look at making collapse events journals civil wars etc late game. 
		- Event chain for when the first ruler of Basileia Romaion dies
			- Make Purple Born added to new rulers if they don't have it.
			- House of the Dragon inspired Scenario With Aurelia and the more progressive elemenets in Greece Proper and a younger son in Anatolia with the conservatives and whichside you pick also gets Konstaintople. 
			- civil war could use elements of usa event chain.
		- Continue working on separatist events make sure they trigger at appropriate and only once per event.
