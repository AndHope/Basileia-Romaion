	###World & Balance
		- Revamp Sicily
			- New Cultures
			- 
		- HRE
			- Should be a mid-late game powerhouse for the AI possibly more challenging for the player somehow. (AI only buffs a possible thing I have no idea?)
			- Some sort of Journal explaining the situation and the semi feudal system they start with.
			- Give them optional paths liberalize path and autocratic path similar to the PLC content.
				- Rise of Napoleon type figure.
				- Journal entry to encourage them to annex their vassals ( I can make their AI more aggressive to certain tags cultures etc when they have certain JEs. recently added this to the ERE hence why its way better at regaining its breakaway regions.)
	
		- Continue tech balance
