 br_nation_startup_event.1.d: "Serbia"
 br_nation_startup_event.1.f: "The Kingdom of Serbia found itself caught in the midst of a political battleground. Hungary and the Basileia Romaion vied for influence over the Balkans, their ambitions casting a shadow over the serenity of Serbian lands. Recent turmoil in the Baselia Romaion had emboldened Hungary to assert its dominance, and Serbia had not been spared from the consequences. Subjugated by Hungarian forces, the once-independent kingdom now found itself under the yoke of foreign rule. Serbia, navigated the treacherous waters of diplomacy with a keen eye and a steady hand. Though Serbia's autonomy had been compromised, its spirit remained unbroken. Within the walls of Belgrade, defiance simmered beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to ignite into action."

 br_nation_startup_event.9.d: "The Holy Roman Empire: Charlegmagne’s Legacy"
 br_nation_startup_event.9.f: "Ever since our great Emperor Charlegmagne was crowned in the year of our Lord 800 A.D., we have been seen as the continuation of the Western Empire! At least for a time, while the division of Chalcedonian Christendom was delayed until roughly the 1200’s A.D. the disagreements between the Western and Eastern Churches could not be rectified, and would only exacerbate with the Protestant reformations of the 1500’s. Unlike our Eastern brothers, we stayed loyal to His Holiness, the Patriarch of Rome, in the Eastern Roman’s eyes, our legitimacy as the Western continuation faltered, and that view would only spread, even among our fellow Catholic nations. Even the Pope doesn’t even call us the Western Romans now, the Holy Roman Empire is what we are called by him and most of our fellow Catholics, and the Frankish Empire by all the rest, in part that now all we directly hold is Francia. But now there is a growing feeling that a new era is dawning, and we must take the reins of it. We must end our feudal system like many others in Europe have, fully consolidate our vassals and begin to fully modernize our government, industry and military. We will not be unchallenged however, reactionaries in our own borders may try to keep the status quo, in our state of reforming, the heathens and heretics around us may see it as ample time to strike, and even His Holiness Himself may have the gall to try and take our title away in the Papacy’s growing ambition to reunite the ancient Roman homeland. But by the Grace of Holy God we will succeed, we will purge the heretics from Europe, we will take back Iberia for Christ, we will declare our own Crusades against those who deny his word! And if God willing, we will take back our rightful seat in Roma and declare ourselves as the true Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum!"
