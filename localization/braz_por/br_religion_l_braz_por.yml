 revive_khazer_khanate_decision: "Revive the Khazar Khaganate"
 revive_khazer_khanate_decision_desc: "Jews from both the Islamic world and Basileía Romaíon are known to have migrated to Tartaria during periods of persecution under Heraclius, Justinian II, Leo III, and Romanus Lakapēnos. For Simon Schama, Jewish communities from the Balkans and the Bosphoran Crimea, especially from Panticapaeum, began migrating to the more hospitable climate of pagan Tartaria in the wake of these persecutions, and were joined there by Jews from Armenia. The Geniza fragments, he argues, make it clear the Judaising reforms sent roots down into the whole of the population. The pattern is one of an elite conversion preceding large-scale adoption of the new religion by the general population, which often resisted the imposition. One important condition for mass conversion was a settled urban state, where churches, synagogues or mosques provided a focus for religion, as opposed to the free nomadic lifestyle of life on the open steppes."

 pentarchy.1.t: "The Restoration of the Pentarchy"
 pentarchy.1.d: "The reunification of the great seats of Eastern Christendom under the rule of the Basileus in Konstantinople stands as a momentous historical event. This signifies the resurgence of Basileia Romaion over regions that had long been detached from its central authority. This development holds profound implications not only in the political arena but also for cultural and religious matters. The revival of Konstantinople as the center of Eastern Christendom fosters a renewal of its role as a hub of culture and learning, promoting a resurgence of Romaion art, literature, and philosophy. This historical milestone represents a pivotal step in the modern history of the Basileia Romaion and Eastern Christendom, reaffirming the enduring legacy of this empire."
 pentarchy.1.f: "With the heartlands of Eastern Christianity now under our control, religious and social leaders are calling for the reunification of the Imperial Office with that of Partiarchate. This historic development marks a significant moment in our history, as it reflects the desire to harmonize the spiritual and political aspects of the Basileia Romaion"
