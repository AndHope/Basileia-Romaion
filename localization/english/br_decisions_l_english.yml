 #Armenia
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_karin: "Move the Capital to Karin"
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_karin_desc: "For centuries, Ani has stood as the heart of the Armenian nation—a city of a thousand churches and immeasurable pride. Yet as the tides of politics shift and borders grow perilous, the once-great capital now lies too close to danger. In the highlands of Karin, nestled against ancient trade routes and Roman stone, we see the promise of renewed greatness. Let us raise a new capital—not merely a seat of rule, but a beacon of Armenian endurance."
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_ani: "Return the Capital to Ani"
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_ani_desc: "The call of Ani has never faded. Though war and exile forced our court from its ancient throne, the spirit of the city endured in every church bell and pilgrim’s prayer. Now, with the realm more secure and our enemies held at bay, the time has come to return. Let Ani rise once more, not in ruin, but reborn—as the capital of our people and the sanctuary of our soul."
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_yerevan: "Establish the Capital at Yerevan"
 br_armenia_move_capital_to_yerevan_desc: "In the shadow of Mount Ararat lies Yerevan, an ancient fortress city with roots older than memory. Long overlooked in favor of Ani’s grandeur or Karin’s stone ramparts, Yerevan now stands at the crossroads of trade, culture, and modern administration. As our vision for the nation grows ever more ambitious, so too must our seat of governance reflect this forward march. Let us raise Yerevan from a frontier stronghold to the beating heart of the nation—a new capital for a new century."
 
 aegypt_submit_to_konstantinople_decision: "Submit to the Basileía Rōmaíōn"
 aegypt_submit_to_konstantinople_decision_desc: "The drums of war echo along the Nile. With the Basileía Rōmaíōn increasingly asserting dominance in the eastern Mediterranean, our advisors warn that continued defiance may bring catastrophe. Yet there is another path — diplomacy. A treaty of submission, offered in exchange for recognition, protection, and peace.To many in the court, the thought of subjugation is unthinkable. But others recall the devastation of past invasions and see prudence in securing our future beneath the aegis of the two-headed eagle."
 
 claim_india_company_decision: "Reassert Imperial Charter over the Indian Trade Company"
 claim_india_company_decision_desc: "The Emporikē Hetaireia tēs Indikēs was founded under the auspices of the imperial court to oversee commerce from the Red Sea to the coasts of India. Yet in recent decades, its operations fell increasingly under Aegyptian control, drifting from the authority of the Chrysoboulleios seal. Now that Aegyptios has returned to the imperial fold as our protectorate, the time is ripe to restore the company to its rightful place as a direct instrument of the Basileía Rōmaíōn. By formalizing it as a chartered company under the Empire itself, we reclaim our commercial destiny in the East — and with it, the ports, posts, and profits that fuel our dominion. The double-headed eagle shall cast its shadow from Alexandria to Malabar once more."

 claim_kyrenaica_colony_decision_desc: "The lands of Kyrēnía — once a proud province of the Rōmaíōn — have languished as a peripheral holding under Aegyptian oversight.

Let no one doubt that the eagle still watches over Libya."

 claim_br_australis_colony_decision: "Put Australis under the Imperial Colonial Authority"
 claim_br_australis_colony_decision_desc: "Across the far seas lies Australis, a new and distant land where Romaioi settlers laid foundations in our name. Yet such vital territory cannot remain under the stewardship of a provincial court — not when imperial ambition stretches across oceans. With Aegyptios subject to the will of the Basileus, the time has come to bring Australis fully under the imperial aegis. The colony shall be reorganized, fortified, and elevated as a jewel of overseas expansion — governed not in proxy, but by the Senate and the Crown. Let Australis rise not as a distant outpost, but as a true province of Nova Roma."
 
 cahokia_elysium_protection_decision: "Submit to Elysium as a Protectorate"
 cahokia_elysium_protection_decision_desc: "In the shadow of rising powers and foreign ambitions, the leaders of Cahokia weigh the future of their people. To stand alone may invite conquest or isolation — but to align with the Elysians offers another path. By accepting protectorate status under Elysium, we gain access to their technological knowledge, secure our borders through their military guarantees, and ensure favorable treatment in diplomacy and trade. While sovereignty will be tempered, our traditions may yet survive and flourish within their orbit. Let this be a pact of survival — and of opportunity."

 br_decision_annex_siberian_tribes: "Annex the Siberian Tribes"
 br_decision_annex_siberian_tribes_desc: "The Siberian tribes have long resisted our attempts to bring them under our rule.

By integrating these tribes into our empire, we can secure our southern borders and expand our influence beyond the nile."
