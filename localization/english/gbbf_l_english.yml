 grefm.111.t: "The Kopais Plain"
 grefm.111.d: "With advances in Greco-Roman engineering, land surveyors have suggested that the state may be able to reclaim fertile lands currently submerged beneath Lake Kopais in Attica."
 grefm.111.f: "Historical Note: Lake Kopais was once drained by the Mycenaneans over 3000 years ago in what was an incredible feat of prehistoric engineering. The lake refilled as their stoneworks failed over the millennia. Villagers along the banks of the lake frequently complain of flooding and high water tables during heavy inflows into the lake."
 grefm.111.a: "We will see what can be done."
 grefm.111.tt: "You may now take a decision to #bold Drain Lake Kopais#!."
 grefm.112.t: "The Kopais Plain Reclaimed"
 grefm.112.d: "Years of steady work have borne fruit and Lake Kopais has been transformed into the Kopais plain. Already countless farmers have bgun agricultural activity across the lakebed with the hope that these plains will be cultivated for generations to come."
 grefm.112.f: ""
 grefm.112.a: "A magnificent accomplishment."
 grefm.113.t: "A Citadel Emerges"
 grefm.113.d: "As the waters of Lake Kopais recede, researchers have taken note of a raised outcropping into the lake. While the site has been known to contain an ancient ruin, ephors from the Archaeological Service have suggested it may have played a larger role in relation to the shrinking lake and have requested authorization to excavate the area."
 grefm.113.f: "The ruins, called "Gla," overlooks the Kopais Plain. Ignored until the draining of the lake, it shows promise as an early Hellenic site."
 grefm.113.a: "We will see what can be done."

 grefm.119.t: "Land Reclaimed in Kopaida"
 grefm.119.d: "Lead engineers on the Lake Kopais project have announced the reclamation of several large tracts of land from the lake."

 grefm.130.t: "The Corinth Canal"
 grefm.130.d: "Following the conclusion of a detailed survey in [SCOPE.sState('corinth_canal_site').GetNameNoFormatting], [SCOPE.sCharacter('ig_intelligentsia_scope').GetFullName] has declared that it may be possible to complete the bold plan envisioned by the late statesman, Ioannis Kapodistrias: a maritime canal cutting across Corinth."
 grefm.130.f: "Since the days of ancient Greece, the Isthmus of Corinth has served as a vital link between the Peloponnese and Greater Greece. With our modern innovations, it may be possible to link the Ionia and Aegean Seas where historical attempts have failed."
 grefm.130.a: "Let our work begin."
 grefm.130.tt: "You may now begin construction on the Corinth Canal."
 grefm.131.t: "The Corinth Canal Completed!"
 grefm.131.d: "After years of labor, we have successfully carved a canal across Corinth and the waters of the Aegean and Ionian seas now mingle across the isthmus."
 grefm.131.f: "With its towering limestone walls, this canal drastically shortens voyages from Thrace to Western Europe."
 grefm.131.a: "This is a marvel of Greco-Roman might."


 grefm.140.t: "The Archaeological Society of Athens"
 grefm.140.d: "With support from both politicians and scholars, archaeologists from across Greece have begun a process of locating, securing, and restoring the numerous relics of Ancient Greece. Ephors from the Hellenic Archaeological Service have prepared a list of sites for immediate study."
 grefm.140.f: "Founded in 1837, the Archaeological Society of Athens was instrumental in cataloging and restoring countless ruins and artifacts extending from as recent as Medieval times to as far back as the Hellenic Bronze Age."
 grefm.140.a: "A noble effort."
 grefm.140.a.tt: "You may now choose to launch an archaeological study from the journal."

 grefm.142.d2: "Against the tide of institutional and cultural momenentum, the directors of the Archaeological Service have approved the study of Ancient Hellenic-era sites in addition to ruins from the Medieval Era."
 grefm.142.f: "This decision has proven unpopular within our academia, with many voicing concerns that aknowledging this aspect of our history will dilute our cultural identity."
 grefm.142.a: "Certainly a unique intiative."
 grefm.142.b: "Perhaps this isn't the best idea..."
 grefm.142.tt1: "You will now have access to #yellow Hellenic#! dig sites."
 grefm.142.tt2: "You will now have access to #yellow Roman#! dig sites."
 grefm.143.t1: "Acropolis of Athens Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d1: "Ephors have announced the completion the enormous project to clear and catalogue the site at the Acropolis. Amongst the piles of discarded bricks and stones, over a dozen unique sites have been identified throughout the hilltop. Most prominent among these is the Parthenon, an ancient monument-treasury and later church, that currently hosts a mosque at its heart. Dating as far back as the Mycenaean period, the Acropolis has been built over and repurposed countless times over the millennia. Several temples, sanctuaries, and gateways dot the site, each having found new uses under successive regimes to the modern day."
 grefm.143.t2: "Parthenon Site Excavated"
 grefm.143.d2: "The abandoned mosque has been demolished and the site cleared at the Parthenon. Under the supervision of Architect Nikolaos Balanos, the shattered remains of the Parthenon have been identified and reassembled using iron and concrete for structural reinforcement."
 grefm.143.t3: "Knossos Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d3: "Building on the initial discovery of the site by Minos Kalokairinos in the 1870s, a team has uncovered an enormous throne room at the heart of a Bronze Age Palace. Further work has uncovered the sprawling remains of palace complex and ancient urban site.U ntil the formal excavations at Knossos, the role of Crete in the Minoan civilization was unclear. With the discovery of the palace complex, the city's position at the heart of the Minoan Civilization has been confirmed."
 grefm.143.t4: "Minoan Palace Restored"
 grefm.143.d4: "With the aid of Englishman Arthur Evans, laborers have completed an extensive reconstruction of the palace and its associated buildings. Several chambers and frescoes have been painstakingly rebuilt, with artisans blending the modern repair work with the ancient aesthetics. While impressive, the "reconstitution" of the palace attracted criticism with many arguing that Evan's "artistic license" has created a misleading representation of the past."
 grefm.143.t5: "Citadel of Gla Excavated"
 grefm.143.d5: "The Ephor overseeing activities at the Gla site has reported the completion of a comprehensive detailing of the site. Excavations of several buildings at the site have shown that Mycenaean architecture was already beginning to resemble that of Classical Greece. The ancient citadel sprawls across an outcrop that juts far into former Lake Kopais. Measuring larger then the footprint of ancient Athens, the site is defined by two major features: a palace-like structure in the north and two warehouse-like structures in the south. Scholars have theorized that the entire site may have served as a temporary shelter in times of war or hardship."
 grefm.143.t6: "Delos Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d6: "Situated amongst the Cyclades, Delos was the mythological core of the Aegean Sea. With the island abandoned since Medieval times and managed only by a small caretaker population, the "excavations" at Delos have been more of just an accounting of the various structures located at the site. Several temples and social centers survive in remarkable condition."
 grefm.143.t7: "Larissa Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d7: "While several Greco-Roman cities have been abandoned over the years, some, like Larissa have been in continuous use, with medieval and modern buildings coexisting with archaic structures. After exhaustive efforts, the Archaeological Service has detailed several ruins and structures that dot the city. As lists are distributed to local officials, the hope is that urban planners can avoid disruption of known ancient sites."
 grefm.143.t8: "Rhodes Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d8: "Inhabited since the time of Mycenaneans. Alongside that came populations of Jews, Pagans and Christians, giving the island an incredible variety of culutral influences. However, despite the numerous finds, the supervising ephor was disappointed to announce that no signs of the fabled Colossus of Rhodes have been found."
 grefm.143.f: "With every ancient site surveyed, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]'s connection to antiquity grows clearer and stronger."
 grefm.143.a: "Excellent Work!"
 grefm.144.t1: "Hexamilion Wall Examined"
 grefm.144.d1: "Ephors from the Archaeological Service have announced the completion of a sprawling survey detailing the extent of the Hexamilion Wall. Stretching across the isthmus, its ruins have provided experts with several major artifacts from the Roman era."
 grefm.144.t2: "Acrocorinth Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d2: "Following months of efforts, ephors have cleared and documented the majority of the massive structure of the Acrocorinth. they have identified a storied history stretching from a Medieval fortress, to an Orthodox church, and later a mosque. Many are eager to open the site to the public."
 grefm.144.t3: "Heptapyrgion Restored"
 grefm.144.d3: "The Heptapyrgion presents a stunned example of the architecture from the height of the Medieval era. With major restoration work already underway, the Archaeological Service has voiced enthusiasm for the use of the site as a centerpiece in Medieval education."
 grefm.144.t4: "Workshops of Thebes Excavated"
 grefm.144.d4: "Ephors have announced the completion of their massive effort to locate and catalogue the numerous small ruins throughout Thebes. In the Medieval era, many of these buildings served as the beating heart of the Greco-Roman silk industry."
 grefm.144.t5: "Nicomedia Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d5: "Through a mixture of public surveys and private reporting, ephors have detailed a series of reports showing the extensive Roman history of the city. The expansivness of the ruins have made it difficult to tell where ancient ruins end and modern city begins."
 grefm.144.t6: "Smyrna Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d6: "Ephors have announced the conclusion of their survey of the extensive ruins in Smyrna."
 grefm.144.t7: "Tyana Excavated"
 grefm.144.d7: "While Tyana was lost to Turkic invasion early in their conquest of Anatolia, this fact hasn't stopped ephors from identifying hundreds of ruins in the old city."
 grefm.144.t8: "Chios Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d8: "Ephors have announced the completion of their survey of the island of Chios. Several ruins have been identified that have secured the island's status as a strategic holding during the earlier Roman era and its subsequent occupation by the Genoese."

 grefm.151.b.tt: "The excavation will be #red delayed#! by 6 months."
 grefm.152.t: "Ancient Tomb Uncovered"
 grefm.152.d: "Ephors have announced that what appears to be a grave site has been found at the excavation site and have called for a more detailed cataloging of grave goods. Planners have cautioned that this approach may introduce a large delay to the project."
 grefm.152.f: "While they may be trinkets of the dead, these grave goods represent some of the best-preserved relics of the era!."
 grefm.152.a: "We will detail everything."
 grefm.152.a.tt: "The excavation will be #red delayed#! by 6 months."
