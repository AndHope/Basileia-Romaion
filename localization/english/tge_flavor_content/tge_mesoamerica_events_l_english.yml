 tge_mesoamerica.100.t: "The Empire of the Dawn"
 tge_mesoamerica.100.d: "The Empire of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] stands strong in [GetStrategicRegion('region_mexico').GetName]. However the many heresies of [GetReligion('br_religion_elysian_orthodox').GetName] infect our citizens and the invaders of [SCOPE.sCountry('tge_louisiane_scope').GetName] have set their eyes on our northern frontier. The Sun-Emperor, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName] now commands his armies forward to secure the future of [GetReligion('br_tge_religion_teotl').GetName] and of the world."
 tge_mesoamerica.100.f: "Legend states that when $tge_huitzilopochtli$ was born, he emerged from the womb clad in armor and bearing arms to defend his loving mother from his jealous siblings. Just as his battle is fought daily in the sun chasing away the moon and stars, so too must we, his chosen sons and daughters, fight to provide him the strength to rise again on the morrow."
 tge_mesoamerica.100.a: "Our warriors will never let the sun die."

 tge_mesoamerica.108.t: "The Coming Darkness"
 tge_mesoamerica.108.d: "The Golden Eagle has failed. It goes beyond any doubt that the Empire of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has been unable to live up to our divine calling. As the population braces for the coming doom, the blame for this failure has been laid squarely at the feet of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName]. He shall pay with his life."
 tge_mesoamerica.108.f: "In [GetCulture('nahua').GetName] culture, once ritual failed and doom was upon the people, this was seen as a sign of divine rejection. The only way to remedy this situation is to sacrifice the failed monarch and pray for forgiveness."
 tge_mesoamerica.108.a: "$tge_huitzilopochtli$ has abandoned us!"
 tge_mesoamerica.109.t: "The Golden Eagle"
 tge_mesoamerica.109.d: "Across [GetStrategicRegion('region_mexico').GetName] all peoples now swear their fealty to the Golden Eagle. With the rituals of $tge_huitzilopochtli$ taking root across the Altiplano, the Empire and its people can rest assured that the future of the dawn shall be secure for generations to come."
 tge_mesoamerica.109.f: "It was the need for sacrifices that first drove the Nahua to expand beyond the shores of [GetRegionState('STATE_MEXICO').GetName]. Now the quest to spread divine truth has led them to bring their entire world under their singular control."
 tge_mesoamerica.109.a: "$tge_huitzilopochtli$ shall shelter to all!"
