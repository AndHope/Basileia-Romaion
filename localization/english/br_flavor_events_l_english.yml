 br_nation_startup_event.1.d: "Serbia"
 br_nation_startup_event.1.f: "The Kingdom of Serbia found itself caught in the midst of a political battleground. Hungary and the Basileia Romaion vied for influence over the Balkans, their ambitions casting a shadow over the serenity of Serbian lands. Recent turmoil in the Baselia Romaion had emboldened Hungary to assert its dominance, and Serbia had not been spared from the consequences. Subjugated by Hungarian forces, the once-independent kingdom now found itself under the yoke of foreign rule. Serbia, navigated the treacherous waters of diplomacy with a keen eye and a steady hand. Though Serbia's autonomy had been compromised, its spirit remained unbroken. Within the walls of Belgrade, defiance simmered beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to ignite into action."

 br_nation_startup_event.2.t: "La Serenissima Ascendant"
 br_nation_startup_event.2.d: "The Most Serene Republic of Venice greets the new century with sails full of promise. From the marble halls of the Doge’s Palace to the furthest colonial outpost, the Lion of Saint Mark watches over a realm forged not by swords, but by silk, salt, and gold. Favorable trade in Andalus, the ERE, and Tartaria fills Venetian ledgers, while new colonies bring opportunity—and ambition."
 br_nation_startup_event.2.f: "But the winds of change blow across the Mediterranean. Rivals grow bold, and new riches lie across uncharted waters. Will Venice remain content as the jewel of commerce, or pursue a destiny yet unwritten?"
 br_nation_startup_event.2.a: "Let gold and glory guide us."

 br_nation_startup_event.3.t: "Between Ledger and Lance"
 br_nation_startup_event.3.d: "The Republic of Genoa enters a new age standing proudly between the sword and the scale. Its merchants thrive in distant courts, its bankers whisper into the ears of emperors, and its galleys carry the fruits of empires. Favor from Andalus, the ERE, and Tartaria opens doors across three continents, while Genoese flags rise above distant shores."
 br_nation_startup_event.3.f: "Yet the world is not ruled by commerce alone. Venice sharpens its claws. The colonies beckon. The republic must choose not just where it trades—but where it rules."
 br_nation_startup_event.3.a: "Let the Griffin rise."

 br_nation_startup_event.4.t: "Heart of the Steam Renaissance"
 br_nation_startup_event.4.d: "From its marble boulevards to the churning factories of its outer districts, Milan stands as the vanguard of a new age. It was here that the Steam Renaissance first took form—where visionaries, engineers, and philosophers converge under the patronage of an Enlightened crown."
 br_nation_startup_event.4.f: "The court pulses with invention, the universities echo with discourse, and the forges of Milan light the path toward a future shaped by reason and progress. But with industrial might comes ambition—will Milan remain content as Europe’s engine, or seize the mantle of leadership in this dawning century?"
 br_nation_startup_event.4.a: "Let industry and intellect shape our legacy."

 br_nation_startup_event.5.t: "The Enlightened Garden"
 br_nation_startup_event.5.d: "Florence awakens once more—this time not as the cradle of art, but as the citadel of progress. Beneath the guiding hand of an Enlightened sovereign, its salons, academies, and treasuries flourish alike. Wealth flows through its trade, and ideas bloom in its streets like spring in the Arno valley."
 br_nation_startup_event.5.f: "Though less industrial than Milan, Florence’s influence lies in its culture, its science, its vision of a world governed not by superstition, but by knowledge. The question now is whether this radiant city will lead by example—or by ambition."
 br_nation_startup_event.5.a: "Let light guide us to greatness."

 br_nation_startup_event.6.t: "The Last Throne of God"

 br_nation_startup_event.8.t: "A Golden Thread Across the Waters"
 br_nation_startup_event.8.d: "Founded in the year 1603 by decree of Tibérios Palaiologos, last undisputed Basileus of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emporikē Hetaireia tēs Indikēs was envisioned as a beacon of imperial commerce, ambition, and maritime power. With Chrysolithos — the gleaming jewel of the western Indian coast — as its beating heart, the Company now spans a vast trade network across the Indian Ocean: from bustling ports along the Red Sea and Madagascar to outposts in India and a solitary yet precious foothold on the Chinese coast."
 br_nation_startup_event.8.f: "Though its golden seal bears the mark of Constantinople, time has weathered the Empire. With the Basileia fractured and distant, the Company now finds sanctuary and strength in the Exarchate of Aigyptios, whose control of the Klysma Canal and Alexandria ensures the continued flow of goods to imperial markets. Despite the Empire’s fragmentation, the Company remains deeply entwined in its economic bloodstream — both a servant and a sovereign.Ties with the great powers of India have remained stable — but tense. In the north, the Mughal Empire maintains its grandeur, while to the south, the Maratha Confederations rise like firestorms from the Deccan. Whispers of war crackle along the coasts, and the Company’s holdings sit directly in the path of the coming storm."
 br_nation_startup_event.8.a: "Riches of the East!"

 br_nation_startup_event.9.t: "Holy Roman Empire"
 br_nation_startup_event.9.d: "The Holy Roman Empire: Charlegmagne’s Legacy"
 br_nation_startup_event.9.f: "Ever since our great Emperor Charlegmagne was crowned in the year of our Lord 800 A.D., we have been seen as the continuation of the Western Empire! At least for a time, while the division of Chalcedonian Christendom was delayed until roughly the 1200’s A.D. the disagreements between the Western and Eastern Churches could not be rectified, and would only exacerbate with the Protestant reformations of the 1500’s. Unlike our Eastern brothers, we stayed loyal to His Holiness, the Patriarch of Rome, in the Eastern Roman’s eyes, our legitimacy as the Western continuation faltered, and that view would only spread, even among our fellow Catholic nations. Even the Pope doesn’t even call us the Western Romans now, the Holy Roman Empire is what we are called by him and most of our fellow Catholics, and the Frankish Empire by all the rest, in part that now all we directly hold is Francia. But now there is a growing feeling that a new era is dawning, and we must take the reins of it. We must end our feudal system like many others in Europe have, fully consolidate our vassals and begin to fully modernize our government, industry and military. We will not be unchallenged however, reactionaries in our own borders may try to keep the status quo, in our state of reforming, the heathens and heretics around us may see it as ample time to strike, and even His Holiness Himself may have the gall to try and take our title away in the Papacy’s growing ambition to reunite the ancient Roman homeland. But by the Grace of Holy God we will succeed, we will purge the heretics from Europe, we will take back Iberia for Christ, we will declare our own Crusades against those who deny his word! And if God willing, we will take back our rightful seat in Roma and declare ourselves as the true Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum!"

 br_extra_immigrants_events.2.d: "The year 1736 has brought a great stirring in the heartlands of the Empire, as thousands of Frankish peasants, craftsmen, and merchants alike—begin a steady march westward toward the promise of Holland."
 br_extra_immigrants_events.2.f: "Driven by the weight of economic stagnation, burdensome feudal dues, and the lure of freer trade and religious tolerance across the border, entire villages have emptied, their homes left to the silence of memory. Imperial officials watch the migration with unease, for each cart that rattles westward carries not only a family's hopes, but the lifeblood of the Empire’s industrious west. Holland, flush with prosperity and hungry for labor, welcomes them with open arms—yet behind every farewell lies a quiet indictment of an Empire slow to change."

 br_nation_startup_event.11.t: "A Land Between Worlds"
 br_nation_startup_event.11.d: "They call us settlers. But we are founders. And this land does not remember the Old World."
 br_nation_startup_event.11.f: "As the smoke of war still lingers between Al-Andalus and Basileía Romaíon, the far colonies of the empire press onward with quiet determination. Among them, the Apokia of Antipódeia—a remote coastal land of sprawling eucalyptus forests, high cliffs, and strange constellations—has become home to thousands of Apoikoi: settlers, refugees, and dreamers who speak the tongue of Basileía Romaíon but dream of something different. Founded by a pact of Romaíoi frontier families, Latínoi merchants, and scholars cast off from the shattered corners of the Roman world, Antipódeia straddles a fragile balance. It is governed by a Domestikos, loyal in name to the Exarch of Aigyptios, who ensures protection and access to the trade arteries flowing from Klysma to Alexandria. Yet around them, other powers grow bold. The Dutch of New Holland grow prosperous along the northern coasts. The mysterious Langfang prospectors drill deeper into their mineral-rich lands. The mighty Emporikē Hetaireia tēs Indikēs spreads its influence from the west, weaving ports and islands into a gilded web of commerce. And the whispers of a long-lost sister colony — Elysium — stir old myths into new purpose."
 br_nation_startup_event.11.a: "Antipódeia must define what it truly is: a child of Basileía Romaíon, a new world commonwealth, or something altogether new"

 br_nation_startup_event.12.t: "Elysium: The Dawning of a New Era"
 br_nation_startup_event.12.d: "Born of empire, forged in exile, and tempered in independence—Elysium stands."
 br_nation_startup_event.12.f: "Once a distant outpost of the Basileia Romaion, the colony of Elysium has grown into a powerful nation across the western ocean. Founded in the name of the Basileus, it was a bold experiment in civilization, a beacon of Roman honor and Hellenic idealism shining from the shores of the New World. But the world changed. The wars between Romaion and Al-Andalus drew the empire’s gaze away. Cut off, the Elysians looked inward, not with despair but with resolve. From a province, they became a people. From subjects, citizens. The Elysian Senate now governs alongside a constitutional monarch, blending republican virtue with imperial legacy. Its people speak a Greco-Latin tongue, worship through a uniquely Elysian Orthodox rite, and practice a policy of cultural integration that has formed three core groups: the Romaioi-descended Elysians, the Latinikoi settlers of Western origin, and the native Elyrics who found kinship in Plethonism. That very Plethonist movement, born of Platonic fire, now burns across Elysium. Though the state adheres to Elysian Orthodoxy, the strength of Plethonist belief threatens to divide the realm—or redefine it entirely. Meanwhile, in the north, Vinland broods. Old gods and new ambitions stir among the Norsemen. The recent conquest of Hyporia by Elysian forces has cooled diplomacy to a wary simmer. Yet trade still flows, as does the rivalry. As the year 1736 dawns, Elysium stands at a precipice. Its enemies are many, but its people are proud. Its culture unique, yet still evolving. A paradise once promised now faces trials of its own making. Will the nation unite behind the dream of Elysium? Or be torn apart by the legacy it was built upon?"
 br_nation_startup_event.12.a: "The Elysian people stand ready. A new world for a new people."

 br_nation_startup_event.13.t: "The Hammer of the North"
 br_nation_startup_event.13.d: "Centuries ago, Harald Hardrada carved a path through fire and blood to forge the North Sea Empire. With victories at Fulford and Stamford Bridge, he united Norway, Denmark, and England under one crown, sweeping aside the old dynasties and securing Norse dominance from the fjords to the Thames.But empires built by conquest rarely know peace."
 br_nation_startup_event.13.f: "In the centuries since, the North Sea Empire has endured. Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and even a portion of England remain within its orbit as autonomous protectorates—nations in name, but ruled in truth by Norse governors and imperial decree. Yet their loyalty is brittle. The old kingdoms simmer with unrest, and nowhere more than in England, where the descendants of the Godwinsons dream still of reclaiming their lost throne. Their rebellion in the early 1600s was crushed, and with it came exile. A great migration followed, led by Anglo-Saxon nobility to the shores of the New World, where they founded New Angland—a bitter colony born of defeat, now rising with pride and purpose. To the west, Vinland endures as the torchbearer of the old gods, fiercely independent from the Christian Empire that birthed it. Though the North Sea Empire claims spiritual kinship, Vinland answers to no king. Reunification remains a dream—one fueled by ambition, faith, and the call of destiny. Now, in the year 1736, the empire stands vast but fraying. Its fleets patrol stormy seas. Its foes plot from within and without. Will the hammer fall once more to forge unity—or will the North Sea Empire be scattered by the winds it once commanded?"
 br_nation_startup_event.13.a: "Let the waves remember who rules them"

 br_nation_startup_event.14.t: "Exiles of Albion"
 br_nation_startup_event.14.d: "In the aftermath of the failed Godwinson Rebellion, a tide of Anglo-Saxon refugees crossed the vast Atlantic, their dreams of freedom and vengeance carried on every wave. Far from the iron grip of Norse rule, they carved out a new homeland in the western wilderness—New Angland, a land built by exiles with old grudges and new hopes."
 br_nation_startup_event.14.f: "Here, the sons and daughters of Albion endure. They have forged a rugged, resilient society guided by a fierce independence and the ancient customs of their forebears. Their speech carries the echoes of Wessex, their banners bear forgotten runes, and their churches sing in older tongues. But the past is never far. The shadow of the North Sea Empire looms large, and many dream of one day returning to their ancestral lands—not as subjects, but as liberators. Others look inward, intent on making this New Angland a nation worthy in its own right. Now, in the year 1736, New Angland stands at a crossroads. Will it remain a sanctuary, a stronghold of the old ways? Or rise as a power that reshapes the New World?"
 br_nation_startup_event.14.a: "From exile, strength."

 br_nation_startup_event.15.t: "A Crown in Shadow"
 br_nation_startup_event.15.d: "When the dragon-sailed ships crossed the whale-road, Albion's crown was cast into the sea. Yet the blood of Hengest and Alfred still burns in our veins. Albion bows to none forever."
 br_nation_startup_event.15.f: "Once, the crown of England held sway over a proud and sovereign realm, the seat of kings and the hearth of an ancient people. But those days are long faded into smoke. Since the fall of the Godwinsons and the rise of the North Sea Empire, England has been but a shadow of itself—its lords answer not to an English monarch, but to a distant emperor across the northern seas. Though the royal blood yet flows in the veins of England’s lords, they wear no crowns. They preside over scattered shires, their banners lowered beneath the raven-standard of the Norse kings. Parliament is but a memory, and London—the heart of the realm—lies beyond their reach, held fast by imperial governors and loyal jarls. What remains is a patchwork of fiefdoms ruled more by tradition than by law, bound together by oaths grown thin with time. Yet beneath the veneer of loyalty, something stirs in the hearts of the English. The old tales are whispered once more in the mead-halls and manors—of Alfred and Æthelstan, of freedom hard-won and kingdoms forged in fire. The dream of an England unshackled has not died—it smolders, patient, in the ashes. How long before it burns anew?"
 br_nation_startup_event.15.a: "Though broken and bound, the soul of England smolders. From ash and oath, a kingdom shall rekindle."

 br_nation_startup_event.16.t: "The Flame Endures"
 br_nation_startup_event.16.d: "They said we would fade — swallowed by ice, distance, and time. Yet here we remain. Vinland, carved from snow and saga, endures under the wide sky of the New World."
 br_nation_startup_event.16.f: "Our ancestors came seeking freedom, fleeing the thrones of Christendom and the iron chains of kings. Here, on this untamed shore, they found a new life — one ruled by clan, honor, and the gods of old. While the North Sea Empire swells across the sea and Elysium grows to our south, we remain true to the path of the Aesir. But not all in Vinland look to the past. The lands to the west lie open, vast and fertile, whispering of new homesteads and hidden riches. And within our own halls, whispers grow louder: crosses raised beside runestones, prayers to a single god echoing through longhouses. The fire of the old faith flickers in the wind, challenged not only by steel and empire — but by scripture. Yet we are not broken. We are not forgotten. We are Vinland."
 br_nation_startup_event.16.a: "Westward we go, as gods and ancestors walk beside us."

 br_nation_startup_event.17.t: "Sands of the Twice-Born Crown"
 br_nation_startup_event.17.d: "From the haze of the desert dawn, the Nile winds like a green ribbon through gold, carrying with it whispers of gods, empires, and betrayals. This is Aegyptios—Rome’s oldest shadow and its most vital artery, where minarets rise beside marble domes, and the world’s wealth flows through ports lined with Latin merchants and Komnenian banners."
 br_nation_startup_event.17.f: "Centuries ago, the Komnenos dynasty ruled all of Rome from the gleaming capital of Konstantinople. They were emperors of conquest and renewal—until decadence hollowed their throne and Tibérios Palaiologos seized power in a bloodly coup. The dynasty fled, but they did not fall. In the sun-baked heart of Aegypt, where loyalty to their line had never faded, the Komnenoi returned. With the people at their back and the Exarch overthrown, they reclaimed a fragment of their birthright and shattered the illusion of imperial unity. What rose in Aegypt was not a rebellion, but a resurrection. Backed by Venetian coin and Genoese fleets, the Komnenoi forged a realm of commerce and defiance—de facto sovereign, but nominally bound to the Basileus they once were. Their rule rests upon trade and compromise: the Aegýptian culture blends Romaioi and Coptic traditions, while the cities swell with foreign wealth and Latinoi elites. Yet the Komnenoi govern atop shifting sands. The Muslim majority, long subdued, begins to stir with dangerous resolve. The Copts remain loyal—more out of fear than faith. And the deserts beyond the Nile remain untamed, home to free tribes and Nubian kings. Now, a new Basileus rises in the north—ambitious and devout, eager to reclaim Aegypt for Constantinople and to extinguish the last Komnenian flame. The dust does not forget, and the Nile flows ever forward. What legacy will this second crown leave behind?"
 br_nation_startup_event.17.a: "The Nile remembers the empire that forgot it."

 br_nation_startup_event.18.t: "The Gilded Balance"
 br_nation_startup_event.18.d: "In the great courts of Qurtubah, sunlight spills through latticed arches onto polished marble, where philosophers debate beside merchant princes and the scent of cardamom drifts from the bazaars. Al-Andalus stands unmatched—rich, radiant, and restless."
 br_nation_startup_event.18.f: "Once a beacon of learning and faith, Al-Andalus has become the forge of a new age. From its ports stretch vast arteries of trade and power. It governs the coasts of the Maghreb through client kings and watches over the western isles with a tempered sword. Its colonial empire, centuries in the making, spans sun-drenched plantations, silver-rich highlands, and jewel-like archipelagos. From distant factories and far harbors, wealth flows homeward—fueling invention, patronage, and ambition. The Steam Renaissance, born in Northern Italy, has found fertile ground here. Workshops hum with innovation, and great minds gather under crescent and star to shape the future. Though the Caliph remains as a ceremonial figurehead, true authority lies with councils and scholars, ministers and merchants. Al-Andalus has embraced secular governance and liberal ideals, charting a course few others dare. But the golden surface is beginning to crack. In the hills of Iberia, nationalism stirs among the Christian minority, their tongues whispering of sovereignty and stolen heritage. In the mosques and mountain strongholds, the Islamist reactionaries grow bolder, decrying the liberal order as a betrayal of faith. Neither fire has yet consumed the heartland—but both smolder, threatening to ignite. Al-Andalus stands at the edge of a blade—between past and future, faith and freedom, empire and reform. The moment demands vigilance, vision, and resolve."
 br_nation_startup_event.18.a: "Progress is our prayer; reason, our guide."

 br_nation_startup_event.19.t: "At the Crossroads of Empires"
 br_nation_startup_event.19.d: "High upon the Armenian Highlands, a nation stirs once more. Battered by the tides of conquest, partition, and exile, Armenia now gazes out across the mountains, valleys, and borders that have shaped its soul. From the ruins of ancient Tigranocerta to the echoes of Ani’s cathedrals, the weight of history is both a burden and a banner."
 br_nation_startup_event.19.f: "To the west lies the shadow of empires past. To the east, the allure of renewal and risk. Northward, distant kin await a voice. Southward, ancient enemies stir behind uncertain lines. The future of Armenia will not be granted — it must be forged, reclaimed, remembered."
 br_nation_startup_event.19.a: "Let us rise, a beacon between worlds."

 br_nation_startup_event.20.t: "Sentinel of the Caucasus"
 br_nation_startup_event.20.d: "The wind that whips across the Caucasus carries stories — of kings and khans, of saints and soldiers, of blood spilled and kingdoms reborn. Georgia, the ancient realm of Kartli and Kakheti, Imereti and Abkhazia, still stands — weathered, proud, and unyielding."
 br_nation_startup_event.20.f: "Oft-invaded yet never erased, the Georgian people have held fast to their language, their Church, and their mountains. But now, new powers knock at the gates — some with gold, others with guns. Will Georgia remain a quiet sentinel, or rise again as a unifier, a patron of faith and learning, a crown among peaks and valleys?"
 br_nation_startup_event.20.a: "We are Sakartvelo — one land, one soul."
