 br_nation_startup_event.1.d: "Serbia"
 br_nation_startup_event.1.f: "The Kingdom of Serbia found itself caught in the midst of a political battleground. Hungary and the Basileia Romaion vied for influence over the Balkans, their ambitions casting a shadow over the serenity of Serbian lands. Recent turmoil in the Baselia Romaion had emboldened Hungary to assert its dominance, and Serbia had not been spared from the consequences. Subjugated by Hungarian forces, the once-independent kingdom now found itself under the yoke of foreign rule. Serbia, navigated the treacherous waters of diplomacy with a keen eye and a steady hand. Though Serbia's autonomy had been compromised, its spirit remained unbroken. Within the walls of Belgrade, defiance simmered beneath the surface, waiting for the right moment to ignite into action."

 br_nation_startup_event.8.t: "A Golden Thread Across the Waters"
 br_nation_startup_event.8.d: "Founded in the year 1603 by decree of Tibérios Palaiologos, last undisputed Basileus of the Eastern Roman Empire, the Emporikē Hetaireia tēs Indikēs was envisioned as a beacon of imperial commerce, ambition, and maritime power. With Chrysolithos — the gleaming jewel of the western Indian coast — as its beating heart, the Company now spans a vast trade network across the Indian Ocean: from bustling ports along the Red Sea and Madagascar to outposts in India and a solitary yet precious foothold on the Chinese coast."
 br_nation_startup_event.8.f: "Though its golden seal bears the mark of Constantinople, time has weathered the Empire. With the Basileia fractured and distant, the Company now finds sanctuary and strength in the Exarchate of Aigyptios, whose control of the Klysma Canal and Alexandria ensures the continued flow of goods to imperial markets. Despite the Empire’s fragmentation, the Company remains deeply entwined in its economic bloodstream — both a servant and a sovereign.Ties with the great powers of India have remained stable — but tense. In the north, the Mughal Empire maintains its grandeur, while to the south, the Maratha Confederations rise like firestorms from the Deccan. Whispers of war crackle along the coasts, and the Company’s holdings sit directly in the path of the coming storm."

 br_nation_startup_event.9.t: "Holy Roman Empire"
 br_nation_startup_event.9.d: "The Holy Roman Empire: Charlegmagne’s Legacy"
 br_nation_startup_event.9.f: "Ever since our great Emperor Charlegmagne was crowned in the year of our Lord 800 A.D., we have been seen as the continuation of the Western Empire! At least for a time, while the division of Chalcedonian Christendom was delayed until roughly the 1200’s A.D. the disagreements between the Western and Eastern Churches could not be rectified, and would only exacerbate with the Protestant reformations of the 1500’s. Unlike our Eastern brothers, we stayed loyal to His Holiness, the Patriarch of Rome, in the Eastern Roman’s eyes, our legitimacy as the Western continuation faltered, and that view would only spread, even among our fellow Catholic nations. Even the Pope doesn’t even call us the Western Romans now, the Holy Roman Empire is what we are called by him and most of our fellow Catholics, and the Frankish Empire by all the rest, in part that now all we directly hold is Francia. But now there is a growing feeling that a new era is dawning, and we must take the reins of it. We must end our feudal system like many others in Europe have, fully consolidate our vassals and begin to fully modernize our government, industry and military. We will not be unchallenged however, reactionaries in our own borders may try to keep the status quo, in our state of reforming, the heathens and heretics around us may see it as ample time to strike, and even His Holiness Himself may have the gall to try and take our title away in the Papacy’s growing ambition to reunite the ancient Roman homeland. But by the Grace of Holy God we will succeed, we will purge the heretics from Europe, we will take back Iberia for Christ, we will declare our own Crusades against those who deny his word! And if God willing, we will take back our rightful seat in Roma and declare ourselves as the true Roman Empire, Imperium Romanum!"

 br_nation_startup_event.11.t: "A Land Between Worlds"
 br_nation_startup_event.11.d: "They call us settlers. But we are founders. And this land does not remember the Old World."
 br_nation_startup_event.11.f: "As the smoke of war still lingers between Al-Andalus and Basileía Romaíon, the far colonies of the empire press onward with quiet determination. Among them, the Apokia of Antipódeia—a remote coastal land of sprawling eucalyptus forests, high cliffs, and strange constellations—has become home to thousands of Apoikoi: settlers, refugees, and dreamers who speak the tongue of Basileía Romaíon but dream of something different. Founded by a pact of Romaíoi frontier families, Latínoi merchants, and scholars cast off from the shattered corners of the Roman world, Antipódeia straddles a fragile balance. It is governed by a Domestikos, loyal in name to the Exarch of Aigyptios, who ensures protection and access to the trade arteries flowing from Klysma to Alexandria. Yet around them, other powers grow bold. The Dutch of New Holland grow prosperous along the northern coasts. The mysterious Langfang prospectors drill deeper into their mineral-rich lands. The mighty Emporikē Hetaireia tēs Indikēs spreads its influence from the west, weaving ports and islands into a gilded web of commerce. And the whispers of a long-lost sister colony — Elysium — stir old myths into new purpose."
 br_nation_startup_event.11.a: "Antipódeia must define what it truly is: a child of Basileía Romaíon, a new world commonwealth, or something altogether new"

 br_nation_startup_event.12.t: "Elysium: The Dawning of a New Era"
 br_nation_startup_event.12.d: "Born of empire, forged in exile, and tempered in independence—Elysium stands."
 br_nation_startup_event.12.f: "Once a distant outpost of the Basileia Romaion, the colony of Elysium has grown into a powerful nation across the western ocean. Founded in the name of the Basileus, it was a bold experiment in civilization, a beacon of Roman honor and Hellenic idealism shining from the shores of the New World. But the world changed. The wars between Romaion and Al-Andalus drew the empire’s gaze away. Cut off, the Elysians looked inward, not with despair but with resolve. From a province, they became a people. From subjects, citizens. The Elysian Senate now governs alongside a constitutional monarch, blending republican virtue with imperial legacy. Its people speak a Greco-Latin tongue, worship through a uniquely Elysian Orthodox rite, and practice a policy of cultural integration that has formed three core groups: the Romaioi-descended Elysians, the Latinikoi settlers of Western origin, and the native Elyrics who found kinship in Plethonism. That very Plethonist movement, born of Platonic fire, now burns across Elysium. Though the state adheres to Elysian Orthodoxy, the strength of Plethonist belief threatens to divide the realm—or redefine it entirely. Meanwhile, in the north, Vinland broods. Old gods and new ambitions stir among the Norsemen. The recent conquest of Hyporia by Elysian forces has cooled diplomacy to a wary simmer. Yet trade still flows, as does the rivalry. As the year 1736 dawns, Elysium stands at a precipice. Its enemies are many, but its people are proud. Its culture unique, yet still evolving. A paradise once promised now faces trials of its own making. Will the nation unite behind the dream of Elysium? Or be torn apart by the legacy it was built upon?"
 br_nation_startup_event.12.a: "The Elysian people stand ready. A new world for a new people."
