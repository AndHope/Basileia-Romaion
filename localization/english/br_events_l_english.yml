 #Start Up Event
 romaioi_startup_events.1.t: "Welcome to #P Basileía Romaíon#!"
 romaioi_startup_events.1.d: "The world stands at the threshold of a new century. From the sun-drenched palaces of Elysium to the marble courts of Konstantinople, from the gilded domes of Al-Andalus to the roaring foundries of Northern Italy, history has taken a different path. This is not the world you know, but one shaped by a thousand diverging choices—where ancient empires endure, new nations rise, and destiny belongs to the bold."
 romaioi_startup_events.1.f: "Set over a century before the familiar age of industry, this is an era of awakening: of steam and scripture, of conquest and reform, of fading traditions and revolutionary fire. It is a time when legacies are reforged, when borders shift and faiths evolve, and where the clash of ideals defines the course of civilization. Inspired by Roman glory, medieval splendor, and Renaissance ambition, Basileía Romaíon invites you to reshape a living, breathing world. Depth, balance, and historical imagination lie at its core.

 aegyptian_crisis_events.1.t: "Reasserting Our Control in Syria"
 aegyptian_crisis_events.1.d: "The Aegyptian Exarchate, nominally our vassal, has been a valuable and integral part of this empire for centuries but has been acting independently under the rule of Ioannes Komnenos. We tolerated the status quo for too long, and this recent aggression must be met with overwhelming force."
 aegyptian_crisis_events.1.f: "\"What once was ours shall be ours again. The imprint we've left on Aegypt and the Levant cannot be ignored. Like the lines that time carves on a mountain, we have also carved our destiny on their land with the footprints of our ancestors.\n\nGo, go now, children of the Sun!\""
 aegyptian_crisis_events.1.a: "Prepare our armies and our diplomats!"

 aegyptian_crisis_events.2.t: "The Romaíon Incursion"
 aegyptian_crisis_events.2.d: "The Romaíoi have begun their machinations to retake the lands we won from them. This is a violation of our sovereignty! However, this is likely to draw the attention of any [Concept('concept_great_power', '$concept_great_powers$')] in Europe, giving us a chance to gain powerful allies in the conflict."
 aegyptian_crisis_events.2.f: "\"I believe the Basilius and I have some unfinished business to attend to.\""

 aegyptian_crisis_events.4.d: "Reports have emerged from the Syrian Frontier; Aegyptian forces have advanced along the coast, capturing most of the Syrian Exarchate."
 aegyptian_crisis_events.4.f: "Fortunately, our Generals in the area quickly secured Antioch. This situation presents an opportunity for us to not only reclaim Syria but also reassert our control over Aegypt."
 aegyptian_crisis_events.4.a: "Immediately declare war on the rebellious Aegyptian Exarchate"
 aegyptian_crisis_events.4.b: "We cannot afford a broader conflict."


 # Palaiologos Reforms Events

 palaiologos_events.1.t: "The Pronoia System"
 palaiologos_events.1.d: "For centuries our administration has depended on tax farming for collecting revenue, but this highly inefficient system leaves much to be desired. Proposals for reform have flooded the Basileus desk, and the nation eagerly awaits our response."
 palaiologos_events.1.f: "Ever since the reign of Alexios II, taxation rights have been auctioned off to the highest bidder, who in turn retain a part of the revenue for personal use. Over time, this has created a cadre of powerful, autonomous, and oftentimes corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting], significantly reducing state revenues.\n\nWhile most agree that the system must change, few agree on how, and fewer still want to antagonize the Dynatói elite."
 palaiologos_events.1.a: "Abolish tax farming, but leave the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting] in place."
 palaiologos_events.1.b: "Let sleeping dogs lie."
 palaiologos_events.1.c: "Abolish the system in fact as well as in name."
 pronoia_abolished: "Pronoia Abolished"

 palaiologos_events.2.t: "An [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Land Code"
 palaiologos_events.2.d: "Our existing system of land ownership is old, inconsistent, and in dire need of reform. Proponents of modernization demand action; how shall the Basileus respond?"
 palaiologos_events.2.f: "Land ownership in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a complicated affair, consisting of an overlapping patchwork of tenured and communal lands, tax-exempt villages, grants of conquest, and a slew of other land categories. Recognizing the current situation's negative impact on state administration and revenue, key figures in Konstantinople push for reform. \n\nFearing conscription and increased taxation however, the Dynatói are sure to disapprove of any change to the status quo. "
 palaiologos_events.2.a: "Reform the system, but recognize traditional land categories."
 palaiologos_events.2.b: "The old system has served us well."
 palaiologos_events.2.c: "Enact a truly modern land code."
 palaiologos.2.tt1: "Dynatói might resist the reform."

 palaiologos_events.3.t: "The Themata System"
 palaiologos_events.3.d: "For centuries consolidation of land to powerful Dynatói, has eruded the Themata system of Farmer-Soldiers the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service has long disapeared, being replaced by vast Dynatói estates worked by peasants."
 palaiologos_events.3.f: "One of the distinctive features of the Themata system is the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service. This system of land grants, known as \"pronoia\", will once again be integral to our defense strategy. It will encourage recruitment, ensure the availability of a standing army, and allow for the efficient mobilization of troops when necessary. These farmer-soldiers and their families will not only serve as the backbone of the military but also contribute to agricultural productivity in their regions during times of peace."
 palaiologos_events.3.a: "Restore the Themata System."
 palaiologos_events.3.b: "Prioritize the Tagmata."
 palaiologos_events.3.c: "Maintain Dynatói privileges."
 #pronoia_abolished: "Pronoia Abolished"
 palaiologos.3.tt1: "May cause a small revolt"
 palaiologos.3.tt2: "May cause a large revolt"
 endlatin.1.tt1: "May cause a Diplomatic situation with the Latin powers."

 palaiologos_events.4.t: "The Matter of the Allogenes"
 palaiologos_events.4.d: "As the imperial γραμματεία undergoes reform, a delicate question arises: shall those not of Romaíoi blood or tongue be granted, at least in name, the right to serve within the sacred machinery of the state? Some argue such inclusion might preserve harmony in our far-flung provinces."
 palaiologos_events.4.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] must weigh the unity of the Basileía Romaíon against the fury of the zealots. To offer rank to the allogenes may win their loyalty—or embolden them. To deny them may spark unrest—or maintain the purity of Romaíon’s civic order."
 palaiologos_events.4.a: "Let them serve—within bounds decreed by the Chrysobull."
 palaiologos_events.4.b: "Whispers of inclusion, perhaps—but no open doors."
 palaiologos_events.4.c: "Romaion is not to be diluted by empty rhetoric. Denied!"
 palaiologos.4.tt1: "Recognizing the allogenes may provoke the wrath of Romaíoi zealots."

 palaiologos_events.5.t: "Whispers of Insurrection"
 palaiologos_events.5.d: "A shadow of treachery has fallen over [SCOPE.sState('paranoia_state_scope').GetCityHubName], where the Patriarch has publicly accused the [SCOPE.sReligion('discriminated_religion_scope').GetName] of conspiring with [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] to undermine the sacred person of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] and sow division within the oikouménē."
 palaiologos_events.5.f: "\"Shall the enemies of Christ sit as equals within the courts of the Empire? Some soft-hearted scribes in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] would say yes—but we, the guardians of the True Faith, see the greater design. The impious plot with foreign princes to rend our dominion like pastry on a patrician’s platter. We must act—or be undone.\""
 palaiologos_events.5.a: "They are whispers only… but they stir unease."
 palaiologos_events.5.b: "Purge the conspirators before they strike. Romaíon shall not fall from within."
 palaiologos.5.tt1: "Radical Orthodox elements may seek to act of their own volition."
 palaiologos.5.tt2: "Your actions have placated the zeal of the Orthodox hardliners."

 palaiologos_events.6.t: "Riot in the [SCOPE.sCulture('mob_victim_culture').GetName] Quarter"
 palaiologos_events.6.d: "Outraged by the Basileus's decree granting legal recognition to non-Romaíoi, and inflamed by rumors of seditious plots backed by foreign gold, a furious [SCOPE.sReligion('mob_religion').GetName] mob has erupted in violence within the [SCOPE.sCulture('mob_victim_culture').GetName] quarter of [SCOPE.sState('mob_state_scope').GetCityHubName]."
 palaiologos_events.6.f: "\"They came bearing clubs and holy banners, their eyes wild with fury—no doubt roused by some fire-tongued preacher stirring fears of apostasy and betrayal. Thus far, only bruises and broken doors, thanks be to God—but a darker wind gathers near the western gate, and the mob does not disperse.\""
 palaiologos_events.6.a: "Let the local archon restore order."
 palaiologos_events.6.b: "Summon the tagmata. The Empire will not yield to chaos."
 palaiologos_events.6.c: "Let them vent their rage—better a broken quarter than a broken peace."
 palaiologos.6.tt1: "Your actions may provoke greater unrest in the coming days."
 palaiologos.6.tt2: "Your intervention may prevent the situation from escalating."
 palaiologos.6.tt3: "Neglect may invite further violence."

 palaiologos_events.7.t: "The [SCOPE.sState('massacre_state_scope').GetCityHubName] Massacre"
 palaiologos_events.7.d: "A grim day for the Basileía Romaíon. In [SCOPE.sState('massacre_state_scope').GetCityHubName], a gathering of [SCOPE.sReligion('sunni_religion').GetName] zealots descended into bloodlust, falling upon their [SCOPE.sReligion('massacre_victims').GetName] neighbors with unholy fury. Homes burn, families lie slain, and the streets run crimson with innocent blood."
 palaiologos_events.7.f: "\"Whosoever raises his hand against the innocent shall find no mercy before the Throne. The punishment for blood unjustly spilled shall echo in this life and the next. Hell yawns for the murderer who dons the robe of piety.\""
 palaiologos_events.7.a: "Deploy the tagmata—order shall be restored by fire and iron."
 palaiologos_events.7.b: "Let this carnage serve as a warning to others who would challenge the state."

 palaiologos_events.8.t: "Order Restored in [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetName]"
 palaiologos_events.8.d: "In the aftermath of violence, the streets of [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetCityHubName] begin to hum once more with the quiet rhythm of daily life. Merchants reopen their stalls, families rebuild shattered homes, and even bitter tongues have softened—if only slightly—with gestures of contrition and guarded trust."
 palaiologos_events.8.f: "\"They defiled my shop and blackened my name. Yet I saw two of them dragged away in irons—named by their own kin, no less. Perhaps the hand of justice still moves in this world. Now enough of tears—pass the sugar, this tea stings like vinegar on a wound.\""
 palaiologos_events.8.a: "Kyrie eléison. May it last."

 palaiologos_events.9.t: "Dynatói Resist Kataskeuē"
 palaiologos_events.9.d: "As efforts to catalog provincial holdings for taxation and conscription proceed, the archontopouloi of [SCOPE.sState('peasant_state').GetName] have begun to obstruct the process. Their refusal to submit land records denies the imperial fisc vital revenues and hinders our ability to raise levies in time of war."
 palaiologos_events.9.f: "\"Two centuries has this land been under my house. We have rendered tax and tithe as custom demands. But now, the quill-men of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] invent new contrivances to drain our coffers and send our sons to die on foreign soil. Is this justice—or imperial avarice cloaked in ink?\""
 palaiologos_events.9.a: "Instruct the dioikētēs to purchase their lands—revenue must not be lost."
 palaiologos_events.9.b: "Dispatch [SCOPE.sCharacter('peasant_smashing_general').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('peasant_smashing_general').GetHerHis] tagma to restore order."
 palaiologos_events.9.c: "Let the matter lie—for now, [SCOPE.sState('peasant_state').GetNameNoFormatting] is of little consequence."

 palaiologos_events.10.t: "Conscription and the Allogenes"
 palaiologos_events.10.d: "With the promulgation of a universal stratēía, the Empire now faces a question of principle and pragmatism: shall the allogenes be made to bear arms for the Basileus, or continue to redeem their blood in coin, as has been the ancient compact?"
 palaiologos_events.10.f: "From the earliest days of imperial dominion, non-Romaíoi subjects were spared military duty—rendering instead a tax in gold. Yet with the Empire’s armies strained and modernization underway, voices now rise in favor of a common burden, regardless of creed or lineage. Others caution that to demand blood without coin may bankrupt the treasury."
 palaiologos_events.10.a: "Maintain the tax—let the wealthy buy their peace."
 palaiologos_events.10.b: "Let all subjects serve. Romaíon must be defended by all who dwell within it."

 poland.1.t: "The Commonwealth: The Nobles’ Democracy/The Rome of the Slavs:"
 poland.1.d: "For 167 Years, the Commonwealth has stood as the beacon of Civilization in Eastern Europe!"
 poland.1.f: "For 167 years, our Commonwealth has stood as a unique part of Eastern Europe, having and maintaining a form of governance and liberties that few others have ever seen. But now, we stand stunted, the liberties we created are now abused by the nobles for their own power, the principles we once held have faltered, and lands that were once ours have fallen into the hands of those who would see our Commonwealth fall or are now governed by those wishing to secede! Now, our King, who openly wished to reform us, is dying. If our nation is to survive and thrive once more, change is needed! That change may yet come in our King’s heir, Princess Jadwiga! While dealing with this we must either prepare or strike out against other issues we have, ones with enemies. Internally, we have an issue with the increasingly radicalizing Sarmatist movement who wish to either prevent changes or make our country into a perversion of what it once stood for. Externally, we face threats on all our frontiers. To the East, the conniving Muscovites wish to break free and start their own nation, while their overlords, the Mongol rump state of the Golden Horde wish to have their vengeance for their defeats from us. To our North and West, the Saxons and Swedes also look upon our lands, with the latter taking the Baltics from us some decades ago. We must overcome these challenges, and once we do, a new Golden Age will be upon us!"
 poland.1.a: "For Faith, Law and King!"

 poland.2.t: "Centralization of the Commonwealth"
 poland.2.d: "Oh, how the mighty have faltered. Once our dominion stretched from sea to steppe, and now we struggle to quell mere mobs of Dahlkist agitators. Yet these are laments of the past. With the strength of our benevolent monarch, the rebels have been crushed, and a new renaissance beckons. The Commonwealth shall rise anew, and with it, our rightful place as lords of the East."
 poland.2.f: "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."
 poland.2.a: "Second Union of Lublin"

 poland.3.t: "Centralization of the Commonwealth"
 poland.3.d: "How far we have fallen. Once rulers of lands from the Baltic to the Black Sea, we now find ourselves hounded by mobs of petty Sarmatist nobles. But these are shadows of yesterday. Through the will of our enlightened king, the reactionary scourge has been swept aside. Let this mark the dawn of our renaissance and the rebirth of our eastern dominion."
 poland.3.f: "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide. Thus it has ever been."

 poland.4.t: "Plight of the Ruthenians"
 poland.4.d: "For generations, we have borne the yoke of foreign oppressors—Norse, Tatars, Lithuanians, and now the Poles. But that age ends now. No longer shall we kneel in silence. We rise, not only for ourselves, but for our families, our land, and our future. A new dawn breaks, and we shall be the ones to light the sky."

 poland.6.d: "Rejoice, people, for this is a day your children shall remember with pride. By decree of our sovereign [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFullName], our eastern brethren have been embraced as equals. Though many once called the Ruthenians lazy, arrogant, or unworthy of citizenship in the Commonwealth, those voices now fall silent.

 moldavia_events.1.t: "Between the Hammer and the Anvil"
 moldavia_events.1.d: "The Danubian Principalities find themselves ensnared between the ambitions of greater empires. With the Tatars to the east, the Hungarians to the west, and the Romans watching from the south, Moldavia must tread carefully. A single misstep could spell subjugation—but careful diplomacy and steely resolve may yet carve a path to lasting sovereignty."

 moldavia_events.3.f: "“The best way out is always through.”"

 moldavia_events.4.t: "A Deal with the Devil"
 moldavia_events.4.d: "Our rising strength has not gone unnoticed. The Golden Horde offers us a pact: sever ties with the Hungarians, accept Tatar protection, and in return, Bessarabia shall be restored to our domain. Though it is the exchange of one yoke for another, the rewards—territorial and strategic—are tempting. With Tatar support, the dream of a united Moldavian nation inches closer."

If Wallachia is to secure its independence and survive in this crucible of power, it must proceed with caution—and resolve."

 wallachia_events.3.t: "The Little Union"
 wallachia_events.3.d: "Bound by blood, language, and shared struggle, Moldavia and Wallachia have united at last. Though each principality retains a distinct history, their union marks a turning point in the Vlachian cause. Yet beneath the celebrations, rivalries stir—particularly in Moldavia, where whispers of separatism speak to an uncertain future. A single crown now rests atop two legacies."

 wallachia_events.3.f: "“Unity to be real must stand the severest strain without breaking.”"

 wallachia_events.6.t: "Independence Achieved"
 wallachia_events.6.d: "The Vlachian parliament, declared full independence. Our people have cast off the chains of Hungarian suzerainty—earned not through words, but with blood in the War of Independence. Though tensions with our former Tatar allies emerged over Southern Bessarabia, we secured a just peace: the vital region of Northern Dobruja now stands proudly under our banner."

 greek_revolt.1.f: "Latin banners fly over once-loyal islands.

Over time cracks have started to show as our military, economy, and our God given social structure continue to become more and more outdated. Furthermore, our autonomous vassals and colonies have been calling more and more for increased freedoms and even independence! But before we can truly focus outward, we must focus inward. Due to our internal issues, increasing unrest among the so-called Third Estate has put us under increased threat of revolution, and if one happens, we would be unable to truly stop it. In this, we have two possible solutions… We can either embrace some of these would be Revolutionaries ideas and reform our great nation and bring it into this increasingly liberalizing world, by granting freedoms, abolishing serfdom, and replacing our outmoded economic and military structures! Or… We can embrace our own reforms, and suppress these Godless liberals by modernizing our military, centralizing our government around God’s chosen Emperor of the Romans, and bringing our economy to a state of modernized Feudalism! In either of these solutions, we will have some push back among the First and Second Estates, but if we fail, and the patience of the people wanes, our monarchy and our way of life will be drastically and irrevocably altered… Regardless, one of our first possible steps will be to deal with our schism on our national identity in this world where national identity is growing in importance."

They feel that they should be in charge of all our holdings in the region and they say that it would be better for us as the Dutch East Indies might still be disloyal to us and desire to break free, joining the holdings could perhaps stop this. But some worry that this might make the Ostend Company too strong and that keeping the Dutch East Indies around might be a good idea to keep the Ostend Company in line."

 #Armenia decisions
 # Karin Capital Move Event
 br_armenia_capital.1.t: "A New Capital in the Highlands"
 br_armenia_capital.1.d: "The walls of Ani have borne the glories and tragedies of the Armenian people, but now they stand too close to danger. The Turks and Persians presses near, and whispers of conflict grow louder with each passing season. In the ancient fortress-city of Karin, nestled in the highlands where East meets West, many see the promise of renewal—strategic, defensible, and steeped in heritage.\n\nCourt advisors urge the relocation of our capital to this venerable city. Some call for its renaming, to reflect the dawn of a new Armenian era. The old guard balks at such upheaval, but others say this is a chance to shape history.\n\nShall we turn our gaze toward Karin, and write a new chapter for our people?"
 br_armenia_capital.1.a: "Let us found our future in Karin."
 br_armenia_capital.1.b: "No—Ani still stands strong."

 # Ani Capital Restoration Event
 br_armenia_capital.2.t: "A Homecoming to Ani"
 br_armenia_capital.2.d: "Once called the “City of a Thousand Churches,” Ani was the heart of a mighty realm. War and necessity forced the court to flee, but now—stabilized and emboldened—the cry rises: “Back to Ani!”\n\nReligious leaders speak of divine providence. Scholars speak of heritage. Yet others warn that this move could stir unrest in Karin, which has grown proud in its newfound prominence. The return to Ani would be more than symbolic—it would be a statement of purpose, a return to the soul of Armenia.\n\nShall we heed the call?"
 br_armenia_capital.2.a: "Let Ani rise again."
 br_armenia_capital.2.b: "The past must remain the past."

 # Yerevan Capital Move Event
 br_armenia_capital.3.t: "Toward the City Beneath Ararat"
 br_armenia_capital.3.d: "Beyond the ruins and relics of older capitals lies Yerevan—a city of ancient roots but youthful promise. Nestled in the Ararat plain, it is a gateway to commerce, culture, and the borderlands. Reformists and merchants alike call for the court to move there, envisioning a forward-facing capital unburdened by old wars and walls.\n\nStill, such a move would break with centuries of tradition. The clergy murmurs uneasily. Yet the mountain watches, eternal and silent.\n\nShall we let Yerevan rise as the beacon of a new age?"
 br_armenia_capital.3.a: "Let Ararat watch over our capital."
 br_armenia_capital.3.b: "The city is not yet ready."
