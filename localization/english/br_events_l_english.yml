 # Palaiologos Reforms Events

 palaiologos_events.1.t: "The Pronoia System"
 palaiologos_events.1.d: "For centuries our administration has depended on tax farming for collecting revenue, but this highly inefficient system leaves much to be desired. Proposals for reform have flooded the Basileus desk, and the nation eagerly awaits our response."
 palaiologos_events.1.f: "Ever since the reign of Alexios II, taxation rights have been auctioned off to the highest bidder, who in turn retain a part of the revenue for personal use. Over time, this has created a cadre of powerful, autonomous, and oftentimes corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting], significantly reducing state revenues.\n\nWhile most agree that the system must change, few agree on how, and fewer still want to antagonize the Dynatói elite."
 palaiologos_events.1.a: "Abolish tax farming, but leave the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting] in place."
 palaiologos_events.1.b: "Let sleeping dogs lie."
 palaiologos_events.1.c: "Abolish the system in fact as well as in name."
 pronoia_abolished: "Pronoia Abolished"

 palaiologos_events.2.t: "An [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] Land Code"
 palaiologos_events.2.d: "Our existing system of land ownership is old, inconsistent, and in dire need of reform. Proponents of modernization demand action; how shall the Basileus respond?"
 palaiologos_events.2.f: "Land ownership in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a complicated affair, consisting of an overlapping patchwork of tenured and communal lands, tax-exempt villages, grants of conquest, and a slew of other land categories. Recognizing the current situation's negative impact on state administration and revenue, key figures in Konstantinople push for reform. \n\nFearing conscription and increased taxation however, the Dynatói are sure to disapprove of any change to the status quo. "
 palaiologos_events.2.a: "Reform the system, but recognize traditional land categories."
 palaiologos_events.2.b: "The old system has served us well."
 palaiologos_events.2.c: "Enact a truly modern land code."
 palaiologos.2.tt1: "Dynatói might resist the reform."

 palaiologos_events.3.t: "The Themata System"
 palaiologos_events.3.d: "For centuries consolidation of land to powerful Dynatói, has eruded the Themata system of Farmer-Soldiers the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service has long disapeared, being replaced by vast Dynatói estates worked by peasants."
 palaiologos_events.3.f: "One of the distinctive features of the Themata system is the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service. This system of land grants, known as \"pronoia\", will once again be integral to our defense strategy. It will encourage recruitment, ensure the availability of a standing army, and allow for the efficient mobilization of troops when necessary. These farmer-soldiers and their families will not only serve as the backbone of the military but also contribute to agricultural productivity in their regions during times of peace."
 palaiologos_events.3.a: "Restore the Themata System."
 palaiologos_events.3.b: "Prioritize the Tagmata."
 palaiologos_events.3.c: "Maintain Dynatói privileges."

 palaiologos_events.4.t: "Non-Romaíoi rights?"
 palaiologos_events.4.d: "With our move towards a more professional bureaucratic system in motion, demands have been put forth to nominally elevate the legal status of non-Romaíoi, enabling them to serve as civil servants."
 palaiologos_events.4.f: "The preservation of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in the face of unrest, insurrection, and foreign intervention is a, if not the, primary concern of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. If we are to achieve this however, steps to appease our minority subjects might be necessary, lest they become pawns of malicious foreign powers."
 palaiologos_events.4.a: "Equal rights under the law! On paper at least."
 palaiologos_events.4.b: "Promise reform, but let us not get carried away."
 palaiologos_events.4.c: "These are mere concessions masqueraded as reform. Denied!"
 palaiologos.4.tt1: "Elevating the status non-Romaíoi might further antagonize radical Romaíoi voices."

 palaiologos_events.5.t: "Whispers of Insurrection"
 palaiologos_events.5.d: "A climate of paranoia has enveloped the city of [SCOPE.sState('paranoia_state_scope').GetCityHubName], after the Patriarch accused the [SCOPE.sReligion('discriminated_religion_scope').GetName] community of conspiring with [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] to undermine the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
 palaiologos_events.5.f: "\"Are God's adversaries to be the equal of Christ? Some corrupt bureaucrats in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] may think so, but we true believers know better. As we speak, the unbelievers in our midst are busy plotting our doom, conspiring with their foreign masters to carve up our great empire like the confectioner carves up baklava.\""
 palaiologos_events.5.a: "They are just rumors, right?"
 palaiologos_events.5.b: "Crack down hard on suspected traitors, better safe than sorry."
 palaiologos.5.tt1: "Radical Orthodox voices might take matters into their own hand."

 palaiologos_events.6.t: "Riot in the [SCOPE.sCulture('mob_victim_culture').GetName] Quarter"
 palaiologos_events.6.d: "Outraged by the Basileus's decision to elevate the legal status of non-Romaíoi, and spurred on by rumors of foreign-backed insurrection, a large [SCOPE.sReligion('mob_religion').GetName] mob has rampaged through the [SCOPE.sCulture('mob_victim_culture').GetName] quarter of [SCOPE.sState('mob_state_scope').GetCityHubName]."
 palaiologos_events.6.f: "\"They came, wielding sticks and clubs — no-doubt egged on by some militant local preacher. Only some bruises and material damage so far, thank God, but I do not like the look of that crowd over by the western gate.\""
 palaiologos_events.6.a: "This is for the local governor to handle."
 palaiologos_events.6.b: "Muster the army, intervene immediately."
 palaiologos_events.6.c: "Let the mob run its course."
 palaiologos.6.tt1: "Your actions may cause the situation to escalate."
 palaiologos.6.tt2: "Your actions are likely to keep the situation from escalating."
 palaiologos.6.tt3: "Your lack of action is likely to escalate the situation."

In a fit of merciless fury, a large crowd of [SCOPE.sReligion('sunni_religion').GetName] rioters have turned on their [SCOPE.sReligion('massacre_victims').GetName] neighbors. The streets of [SCOPE.sState('massacre_state_scope').GetCityHubName] run red with blood, and large parts of the city is ablaze."
 palaiologos_events.7.f: "\"But whoever deliberately slays another believer, his requital shall be hell, therein to abide; and God will condemn him, and will reject him, and will prepare for him awesome suffering.\"" # An-Nisa 4:3, al-Quran
 palaiologos_events.7.a: "Break up the crowds, with bullet fire if need be."
 palaiologos_events.7.b: "That should keep those would-be traitors in line."

 palaiologos_events.8.t: "Order Restored in [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetName]"
 palaiologos_events.8.d: "A sense of normalcy has returned to the streets of [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetCityHubName]. Storefronts are being rebuilt and restocked, and statements of distrust and hatred are gradually being replaced with ones of reconciliation."
 palaiologos_events.8.f: "\"The bastards ruined my store and insulted my name! But at the very least that was the extent of my injury. My son saw at least two of the men who partook in the riot dragged away by soldiers, apparently outed by their own community. Perhaps there is some justice to be found here after all. Now pass me the sugar, this tea is as bitter as uncured olives.\""
 palaiologos_events.8.a: "God Thanks!"

 palaiologos_events.9.t: "Dynatói Resist Land Registration"
 palaiologos_events.9.d: "With the possibility of increased taxation and military service looming large, retainers from [SCOPE.sState('peasant_state').GetName] have refused to register their land, depriving us of much-needed tax revenue."
 palaiologos_events.9.f: "\"For two hundred years my family has owned this land; paying our dues as we have according to tradition. But now the bureaucrats of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] have devised yet another insidious system for bleeding us dry, and my sons will be called on to perish on some distant battlefield.\""
 palaiologos_events.9.a: "Let local bureaucrats purchase their land, the tax must flow."
 palaiologos_events.9.b: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('peasant_smashing_general').GetFullName] and [SCOPE.sCharacter('peasant_smashing_general').GetHerHis] men will quell this unrest."
 palaiologos_events.9.c: "Leave them be, who cares about [SCOPE.sState('peasant_state').GetNameNoFormatting]?"

 palaiologos_events.10.t: "Drafting non-Romaíoi"
 palaiologos_events.10.d: "With the establishment of a military draft, the state must now decide the role, if any, of non-Romaíoi in our army."
 palaiologos_events.10.f: "The Empire's non-Romaíoi subjects have traditionally been exempt from military service, substituting their blood with a special tax paid to the Basileus. Proponents of army modernization have now suggested the extension of the draft to all [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] subjects, however, this would rob the imperial coffers of an important source of income."
 palaiologos_events.10.a: "Those who can afford it may pay a draft exemption tax."
 palaiologos_events.10.b: "The draft applies to all subjects, regardless of creed."

 poland.1.t: "The Commonwealth: The Nobles’ Democracy/The Rome of the Slavs:"
 poland.1.d: "For 167 Years, the Commonwealth has stood as the beacon of Civilization in Eastern Europe!"
 poland.1.f: "For 167 years, our Commonwealth has stood as a unique part of Eastern Europe, having and maintaining a form of governance and liberties that few others have ever seen. But now, we stand stunted, the liberties we created are now abused by the nobles for their own power, the principles we once held have faltered, and lands that were once ours have fallen into the hands of those who would see our Commonwealth fall or are now governed by those wishing to secede! Now, our King, who openly wished to reform us, is dying. If our nation is to survive and thrive once more, change is needed! That change may yet come in our King’s heir, Princess Jadwiga! While dealing with this we must either prepare or strike out against other issues we have, ones with enemies. Internally, we have an issue with the increasingly radicalizing Sarmatist movement who wish to either prevent changes or make our country into a perversion of what it once stood for. Externally, we face threats on all our frontiers. To the East, the conniving Muscovites wish to break free and start their own nation, while their overlords, the Mongol rump state of the Golden Horde wish to have their vengeance for their defeats from us. To our North and West, the Saxons and Swedes also look upon our lands, with the latter taking the Baltics from us some decades ago. We must overcome these challenges, and once we do, a new Golden Age will be upon us!"

Over time cracks have started to show as our military, economy, and our God given social structure continue to become more and more outdated. Furthermore, our autonomous vassals and colonies have been calling more and more for increased freedoms and even independence! But before we can truly focus outward, we must focus inward. Due to our internal issues, increasing unrest among the so-called Third Estate has put us under increased threat of revolution, and if one happens, we would be unable to truly stop it. In this, we have two possible solutions… We can either embrace some of these would be Revolutionaries ideas and reform our great nation and bring it into this increasingly liberalizing world, by granting freedoms, abolishing serfdom, and replacing our outmoded economic and military structures! Or… We can embrace our own reforms, and suppress these Godless liberals by modernizing our military, centralizing our government around God’s chosen Emperor of the Romans, and bringing our economy to a state of modernized Feudalism! In either of these solutions, we will have some push back among the First and Second Estates, but if we fail, and the patience of the people wanes, our monarchy and our way of life will be drastically and irrevocably altered… Regardless, one of our first possible steps will be to deal with our schism on our national identity in this world where national identity is growing in importance."
