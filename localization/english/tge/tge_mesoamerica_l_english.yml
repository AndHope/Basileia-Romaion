 je_tge_golden_eagle: "The Golden Eagle"
 je_tge_golden_eagle_reason: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetPowerBloc.GetName] has thundered across [GetStrategicRegion('region_mexico').GetName] spreading the might and authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] across the Altiplano like an eagle soaring across the sun. With the might of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] unchallenged, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has become a King of Kings, a God-Emperor whose very body constitutes the connection between the [GetCulture('nahua').GetName] people and $tge_huitzilopochtli$.\n\nAs the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] enforces the dogma of [GetReligion('br_tge_religion_teotl').GetName] on his [concept_subject]#o s#!, the wealthiest regions, the Āltepētlapan, seek to maintain their [concept_autonomy]. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFlag] Empire must secure control over the Altiplano lest it crumble to ruins and the people be delivered unto Mictlantecuhtl."
 je_tge_golden_eagle_complete: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has maximum support."
 je_tge_golden_eagle_fail: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has lost all support."

 je_tge_aztlan: "Reaching for Aztlan"
 je_tge_aztlan_reason: "Centuries ago, our people were driven out from their homes, driven out by the tyrannical king of the land, and guided by Huitzilopochtli to found a new home. That ancestral land was called Aztlan, the Land of Whiteness. Whilst our people may have forgotten the exact location of this land, they at the very least know that it is in the North, where Tezcatlipoca reigns. Let us start our march north and reclaim this ancestral home of ours."

 je_tge_mayan_frontier: "The Mayan Frontier"
 je_tge_mayan_frontier_reason: "For centuries, the Empire has sought to extend its influence beyond the Altiplano and into the lands of [GetStrategicRegion('region_central_america').GetName]. With the League of Màyapáan splintering from within, the time has come for these lands to become true subjects of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
