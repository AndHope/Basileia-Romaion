romaioi_themata_decision:0 "Themata Primacy"
romaioi_themata_decision_desc:0 "The term themata was ambiguous, referring both to a form of military tenure and to an administrative division. A theme was an arrangement of plots of land given for farming to the soldiers "stratiotai" coexisting with different villages and towns, "Komai", "Chora" which were taxed for rapid and continuous revenue for the state with an easy and simple handling for a more direct control of the empire by the Basileus alone or his viceroys, which ultimately was a simplified Hellenistic and fiscal administrative principle adapted for war times.The soldiers were still technically a military unit, under the command of a strategos, they did not own the land they worked as it was still controlled by the state. Therefore, for its use the soldiers' pay was reduced. By accepting this proposition, the participants agreed that their descendants would also serve in the military and work in a theme, thus simultaneously reducing the need for unpopular conscription as well as cheaply maintaining the military. It also allowed for the settling of conquered lands, as there was always a substantial addition made to public lands "proasteion" during a conquest.
The commander of a theme, however, did not only command his soldiers. He united the civil and military jurisdictions in the territorial area in question. Thus the division set up by Diocletian between civil governors (praesides etc.) and military commanders (duces etc.) was abolished, and the Empire returned to a system much more similar to that of the Republic or the Principate or even more linkeable to the system of "Nomarchies" and "Strategiai" of the Hellenistic Ptolemaic and Mithridatric Kingdoms respectively, which were military in origin and organization as well, where provincial governors had also commanded the armies in their area. "
romaioi_tagmata_decision:0 "Tagmata Primacy"
romaioi_tagmata_decision_desc:0 "Basileus Constantine V, reformed the old guard units of Konstantinople into the first Tagmata regiments, which were meant to provide the Basileus with a core of professional and loyal troops. Which are more mobile than the theme troops, and maintained on a permanent basis. During the defensive phase of the Empire in the 8th and 9th centuries, their role was that of a central reserve, garrisoned in and around the capital, in regions such as Thrace and Bithynia. They form the core of the imperial army while on campaign, augmented by the provincial levies of the thematic troops, who are more concerned with local defense."

revive_khazer_khanate_decision:0 "Revive the Khazer Khanate"
revive_khazer_khanate_decision_desc:0 "Jews from both the Islamic world and Basileía Romaíon are known to have migrated to Tartaria during periods of persecution under Heraclius, Justinian II, Leo III, and Romanus Lakapēnos. For Simon Schama, Jewish communities from the Balkans and the Bosphoran Crimea, especially from Panticapaeum, began migrating to the more hospitable climate of pagan Tartaria in the wake of these persecutions, and were joined there by Jews from Armenia. The Geniza fragments, he argues, make it clear the Judaising reforms sent roots down into the whole of the population. The pattern is one of an elite conversion preceding large-scale adoption of the new religion by the general population, which often resisted the imposition. One important condition for mass conversion was a settled urban state, where churches, synagogues or mosques provided a focus for religion, as opposed to the free nomadic lifestyle of life on the open steppes."
