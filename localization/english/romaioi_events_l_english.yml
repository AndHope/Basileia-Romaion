romaioi_startup_events.2.f:0 "The Battle of Manzikret was one of the most pivotal moments in the history of the Basileía Romaíon. The Romaíoi, led by their Basileus, faced off against the Seljuks, a powerful Turkic dynasty that had risen to prominence in the region. The battle was fierce and bloody, with both sides suffering heavy losses. But in the end, neither side was able to claim a decisive victory. Instead, the two sides signed a peace treaty, with the Seljuks agreeing to recognize the sovereignty of the Basileía Romaíon over Anatolia and Armenia, and the Romaíoi recognizing the Seljuks' control over Persia and Mesopotamia. With the peace treaty in place, the Seljuks turned their attention to capturing Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids, caught off guard by the sudden attack, were forced to flee to Mecca, where they had spent the last few centuries reestablishing their authority over all of Arabia. As the Basileía Romaíon continued to expand its power and influence throughout Europe, the Basileus set his sights on the Normans of southern Italy. The Normans, fierce warriors from the north, had established a powerful kingdom in the region, and the Basileus knew that in order to secure his western frontier, he would have to subjugate them. The Basileus assembled a powerful army and set out to conquer the Normans. The battle was fierce, but in the end, the superior tactics and resources of the Basileía Romaíon proved to be too much for the Normans to handle. The Normans were defeated and their kingdom was absorbed into the empire. With the western frontier secure, the Basileus was able to turn his attention to the instability of the Fatamid Caliphate. The Fatamids, a Shia Islamic dynasty that ruled over Egypt, the Levant and North Africa, were in the midst of a power struggle, and the Basileus saw an opportunity to reconquer these regions for the Basileía Romaíon. The Basileus launched a massive campaign to retake the Levant, Egypt and North Africa. The campaign was long and brutal, but in the end, the Basileía Romaíon emerged victorious. The Fatamids were defeated and the regions were once again under the control of the Basileus. As the Basileía Romaíon struggled to maintain control over the newly conquered regions of the Levant, Egypt and North Africa, it became increasingly difficult to keep the peace. The people of these regions had grown accustomed to the Fatamid rule and resented the new administration imposed by the Basileus. To quell the unrest, the Basileus was forced to grant more and more autonomy to these regions over the centuries. This autonomy allowed the people to govern themselves, but it also meant that the Basileus had less control over these regions. Over time, the autonomy granted to these regions grew until they were de facto independent. The Basileus, who was occupied with other matters, had to accept that these regions were no longer under his direct control and the Basileía Romaíon's influence in these regions became limited. When word reached the Romaíon that the Norse had discovered a new continent across the western ocean, the Romaíon leaders knew they had to act fast. They assembled a large expedition, consisting of ships, soldiers, and settlers, with the intent to establish a new colony in the new world. They named this colony Elysium, after the ancient Greek concept of a perfect paradise. The colony prospered in the new land, with the settlers quickly adapting to the new environment and forming a new identity as Elysians. They built homes, farms, and towns, and traded with the native peoples they encountered. The colony grew in size and strength, and soon became a thriving community. But as the years passed, war broke out between the Romaíon and Al Andalus, a powerful empire to the south. The Romaíon leaders were forced to divert resources and soldiers to the war effort, and as a result, Elysium was cut off from the mother country. Despite this, the Elysians did not despair. They knew they were on their own, and they embraced their independence. They established their own government and laws, and continued to build and expand their colony. They traded with other nations and formed alliances, and soon they were a powerful nation in their own right. Years went by and the war ended, but the Elysians did not return to the Romaíon, they had formed a new identity and new way of life. They had found their own Elysium, a new world where they could live free and prosper."

romaioi_themata_decision:0 "Themata Primacy"
romaioi_themata_decision_desc:0 "Themata are the main regional military divisions of the Basileía Romaíon, established during the 9th century CE. The Basileía Romaíon is divided into many themata, each with its own governor, military commander and garrison. The main purpose of themata is to provide a means of defense against the empire's enemies. Each thema is responsible for the defense of a specific geographic area and has its own army. The soldiers are mainly local men, who are conscripted and trained for military service. The themata system allows the Basileía Romaíon to have a more flexible military structure, which can adapt to the changing threats and challenges it faces."

The Excubitors are a heavy infantry unit, while the Vigla are a cavalry unit. The tagmata are typically composed of professional soldiers, and are considered the most elite and well-trained troops in the Byzantine army. They are also among the best-paid soldiers in the empire."

# State Religion Conversions

revive_khazer_khanate_decision:0 "Revive the Khazar Khaganate"
revive_khazer_khanate_decision_desc:0 "Jews from both the Islamic world and Basileía Romaíon are known to have migrated to Tartaria during periods of persecution under Heraclius, Justinian II, Leo III, and Romanus Lakapēnos. For Simon Schama, Jewish communities from the Balkans and the Bosphoran Crimea, especially from Panticapaeum, began migrating to the more hospitable climate of pagan Tartaria in the wake of these persecutions, and were joined there by Jews from Armenia. The Geniza fragments, he argues, make it clear the Judaising reforms sent roots down into the whole of the population. The pattern is one of an elite conversion preceding large-scale adoption of the new religion by the general population, which often resisted the imposition. One important condition for mass conversion was a settled urban state, where churches, synagogues or mosques provided a focus for religion, as opposed to the free nomadic lifestyle of life on the open steppes."
