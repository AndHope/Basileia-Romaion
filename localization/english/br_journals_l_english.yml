During our early wars with our rebellious Exarchates our navy threatened to defect to the Aegyptians multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of Latin powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detachments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."

 palaiologos_reforms.1.t: "Palaiologos Renaissance"
 palaiologos_reforms.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of steady decline. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and reclaim our place among the Powers of the world, we risk catastrophe."
 palaiologos_reforms.1.f: "O Basileus, our empire confronts numerous challenges, yet an opportunity lies before us to rejuvenate our former glory. The Varangians, staunch upholders of the old order resistant to change for centuries, have been overthrown. Our decline since the days of the Macedonian revival and the remarkable Komnenoi restoration, during which we regained dominion over the Balkans, Aegypt, North Africa, and Italia, our fortunes have waned. The corruption prevalent in preceding feeble dynasties has caused the empire to disintegrate and fragment. Influential Dynatoi families have seized your authority, undermining the state for their own gain. Latinoi merchants, granted extensive privileges, have monopolized significant sectors of our economy. Once our mightiest and most loyal assets, the Varangians have betrayed us by selling off the Imperial purple to the highest bidder, enriching themselves and eliminating any ruler attempting to reform the deeply rooted corruption. A substantial undertaking lies ahead of us. We must suppress rebellions and reinforce our control over the Exarchates that have broken away. The Varangians must be replaced with a modern army capable of defending our territories. Furthermore, we must strive to restore the Basileía Romaíon to its former glory as the epitome of civilization.Our primary focus will be on education, urbanization, and sovereignty. It is time for the Palaiologos Renaissance to usher in a new era of enlightenment and strength."

 palaiologos_reforms.2.f: "Sublime. That is the only word for it. To walk the streets of Konstantinople and see modern factories and schools, to see the guards practicing their military drill. A landscape once dominated by peasant farmers is now littered with shining cities. And to think that only a few decades ago Basileía Romaíon was on the brink of collapse! Where once the European powers looked upon us with pity and greedily sought to partition our lands, now we see their diplomats gazing in awe at our accomplishments, forced to recognize us as equals. God is good!"

 palaiologos_reforms.3.f: "The Basileía Romaíon falls silent. Just days after announcing [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] intention to abdicate, most likely under the duress of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] ministers, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been found dead in [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] chambers. Much like our precious empire, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] had been suffering from a long, creeping sickness that ultimately made [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHim] unable to bear the weight of the crown. A broken and deranged shadow of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] former self."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.a: "We belong to God, and to Him do we return."
