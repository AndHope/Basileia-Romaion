 veiled_exarchate_aegypt: "The Exarchate Aegypt"
 veiled_exarchate_africa: "The Exarchate Africa"
 veiled_exarchate_italy: "The Katepaníkion Italia"
 je_veiled_exarchate: "The Exarchate of Aegypt"
 je_veiled_exarchate_reason: "Our influence in Aegypt has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Exarchate. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."
 je_veiled_exarchate2: "The Exarchate of Africa"
 je_veiled_exarchate2_reason: "Our influence in Africa has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Exarchate. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."
 je_veiled_exarchate3: "The Katepaníkion of Italia"
 je_veiled_exarchate3_reason: "Our influence in Italia has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Katepaníkion. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."


 je_palaiologos_reforms_syria: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reclaim Syria"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_syria_reason: "Syria has been lost to the tyrant of Aegypt, who stole his dominion from our rightful hands. We must reclaim it!"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_egypt: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reclaim Aegypt"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_egypt_reason: "The Komnenoi were once emperors of the Roman world—but their time is long past. Though they now rule from the Nile, cloaked in borrowed glory and propped up by foreign coin, their continued defiance is an affront to the imperial order. They do not reign by right, but by rebellion. Our dynasty was chosen—by tradition, by law, and by divine will—to bear the imperial diadem. While the Komnenoi cling to delusions of grandeur in Aegypt, we bear the true legacy of Romaion. Their throne is a splintered relic. Ours is the seat of empire. The Basileía Romaíon cannot be whole while a false crown rests upon the Nile. The Komnenoi must be made to kneel, not merely as rulers of a province—but as subjects of the one true Emperor. Let them swear fealty, or be swept into history."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_africa: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reclaim Afrika"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_africa_reason: "We should turn our attention to Afrika. Our influence in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Exarchate. By reestablishing formal dominion over our rightful possesion, our domination would be assured."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_italy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reclaim Italia"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_italy_reason: "We should turn our attention to Italia. Our influence in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Katepaníkion. By reestablishing formal dominion over our rightful possesion, our domination would be assured."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_elysium: "Palaiologos Reforms: Bring Elysium Home"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_elysium_reason: "We should turn our attention to the new world. Our wayward colony must be brought home."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_australis: "Palaiologos Reforms: Antipódeia Colony"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_australis_reason: "Antipódeia though never a formal colony has been settled primarily from our citizens and cultural sphere."

 je_palaiologos_reforms_navy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Naval Reform"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_navy_reason: "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our early wars with our rebellious Exarchates our navy threatened to defect to the Aegyptians multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of Latin powers to defend our coasts and the straits. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detachments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."

 je_palaiologos_reforms_education: "Palaiologos Reforms: Education Reform"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_education_reason: "So few within our domain have even a basic grasp of literacy. We should establish schools in which to teach them, as well as our own institute of higher learning."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_education_goal: "Increase the literacy rate of your people by 35%."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_separatism: "Palaiologos Reforms: Suppress Separatism"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_separatism_reason: "We have already lost Italia and Afrika; we cannot allow our empire to collapse to separatist rebels."

 je_palaiologos_reforms_security: "Palaiologos Reforms: Lawless Countryside"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_security_reason: "Since the chaos and instability of the previous century the countryside has become lawless and filled with brigands. We must restore order to the countryside."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_land_reform: "Palaiologos Reforms: Land Reform"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_land_reform_reason: "The Dynatoi have seized control of the land and are oppressing the peasantry. We must restore the land to the people."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_army: "Palaiologos Reforms: Army Modernization"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_army_reason: "Though the Varangians have been disbanded, there is far more that must be done to modernize our armed forces."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_curruption: "Palaiologos Reforms: Fight Systemic Corruption"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_curruption_reason: "Fighting the corruption that runs rampant in all levels of society won't be easy many entrenched elites benefit from the status quo and may revolt."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_latin_privileges: "Palaiologos Reforms: End Latin Privileges."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_latin_privileges_reason: "We were forced to give vast economic consessions to the latins in exchange for their help during the troubles. They now enjoy an unfair monopoly on our trade and economy. We must end this."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_west: "Palaiologos Reforms: Balkan Centralization"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_west_reason: "Powerful Dynatói have carved out semi independent estates in the Greek Heartland, we must bring them back under the direct control of Konstantinople."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_east: "Palaiologos Reforms: Anatolian Centralization"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_east_reason: "Powerful Dynatói have carved out semi independent estates in Anatolia, we must bring them back under the direct control of Konstantinople."
 finished_palaiologos_reforms_tt: "Has completed or failed the Palaiologos Renaissance [concept_journal_entry]"
 palaiologos_reforms.1.t: "Palaiologos Renaissance"
 palaiologos_reforms.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of steady decline. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and reclaim our place among the Powers of the world, we risk catastrophe."
 palaiologos_reforms.1.f: "O Basileus, our empire confronts numerous challenges, yet an opportunity lies before us to rejuvenate our former glory. The Varangians, staunch upholders of the old order resistant to change for centuries, have been overthrown. Our decline since the days of the Macedonian revival and the remarkable Komnenoi restoration, during which we regained dominion over the Balkans, Aegypt, North Africa, and Italia, our fortunes have waned. The corruption prevalent in preceding feeble dynasties has caused the empire to disintegrate and fragment. Influential Dynatoi families have seized your authority, undermining the state for their own gain. Latinoi merchants, granted extensive privileges, have monopolized significant sectors of our economy. Once our mightiest and most loyal assets, the Varangians have betrayed us by selling off the Imperial purple to the highest bidder, enriching themselves and eliminating any ruler attempting to reform the deeply rooted corruption. A substantial undertaking lies ahead of us. We must suppress rebellions and reinforce our control over the Exarchates that have broken away. The Varangians must be replaced with a modern army capable of defending our territories. Furthermore, we must strive to restore the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to its former glory as the epitome of civilization.Our primary focus will be on education, urbanization, and sovereignty. It is time for the Palaiologos Renaissance to usher in a new era of enlightenment and strength."
 palaiologos_reforms.1.a: "Great reform is needed."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.t: "Palaiologos Reforms: The Reorganization"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.f: "Sublime. That is the only word for it. To walk the streets of Konstantinople and see modern factories and schools, to see the guards practicing their military drill. A landscape once dominated by peasant farmers is now littered with shining cities. And to think that only a few decades ago [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] was on the brink of collapse! Where once the European powers looked upon us with pity and greedily sought to partition our lands, now we see their diplomats gazing in awe at our accomplishments, forced to recognize us as equals. God is good!"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.a: "The army could use additional reforms."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.b: "We should re-conquer the Balkans!"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.c: "Follow through with urbanization."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.d: "We will reap the benefits of education."
 romaioi_army_reform: "Romaíon Army Reorganization"
 romaioi_urbanization: "Romaíon Urbanization"
 romaioi_education: "Romaíon Education"
 palaiologos_reforms.3.t: "The Palaiologos Failure"
 palaiologos_reforms.3.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has failed to modernize and re-assert itself on the world stage. The vultures begin to circle as the last days of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] draw near."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] falls silent. Just days after announcing [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] intention to abdicate, most likely under the duress of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] ministers, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been found dead in [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] chambers. Much like our precious empire, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] had been suffering from a long, creeping sickness that ultimately made [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHim] unable to bear the weight of the crown. A broken and deranged shadow of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] former self."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.a: "We belong to God, and to Him do we return."

 je_palaiologos_reforms_bureaucracy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Bureaucratic Reform"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.e: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] runs on paper."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_bureaucracy_reason: "Our bureaucracy is a patchwork of archaic laws and systems, with corrupt, autonomous bureaucrats barely exerting control over the Empire's provinces. If we are to overcome the many challenges to our rule, we must modernize our administrative system."

 #PLC
 je_golden_liberty: "Golden Liberty"
 je_eastern_resistance: "The Eastern Troubles"
 je_golden_liberty_reason: "When the Golden Liberty of our Nobles’ Democracy was formed, it was seen as something ahead of its time, giving us the most liberal system in Europe, if not the world! But now, it has become a force to just preserve the status quo, with the Liberum Veto being the most blatant weapon for the Szlachta. We have to change our system, making it more fair, even expanding it if we can!"
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant Tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."

  #Wallachia
 je_little_union: "The Little Union"
 je_little_union_reason: "By abusing loopholes in our treaties with the Great Powers, it is possible to enter in a personal union with Moldavia by electing a ruler in both nations. The Powers will not like it, but they will be powerless to stop our march towards the Union."

  #HRE
 je_the_revolution: "The Revolution"
 je_the_revolution_reason: "The situation in the HRE has grown desperate and the people have had enough. If we don’t do anything then the situation could get out of control and our 1000 year government could be overthrown. We will have to consider carefully how to deal with the situation, do we reform the state or do we choose to suppress these so-called revolutionaries. In case we fail to do anything the consequences could be disastrous."

 je_control_the_lowlands_main: "Control the Lowlands"
 je_control_the_lowlands_main_goal: "Complete 2 'Lowland' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 je_control_the_lowlands_main_reason: "Since the Middle Ages, the lowlands have been one of the richest regions in Europe. Out of all the rivaling states, Flanders was the strongest. But a lot has changed since then, our French rulers are stronger than ever, and the days of small independent lords are over, so before we can break away from their domination, we must centralise and strengthen our control over the region."

 je_restore_serbia_reason: "Autonomous princelings must be fully reincorporated into our realm."
 je_br_gain_independence: "The Struggle for Sovereignty"
 je_br_gain_independence_reason: "We are ruled, but not governed. Bound by treaties, tributes, or the weight of foreign crowns, our people remain denied their rightful voice and destiny. The time has come to cast off the yoke. Whether through arms, diplomacy, or perseverance, we must seize our independence—not as a gift, but as a claim long delayed. No great nation was born free; it was made free."
 je_br_east_indies_trade: "Control trade in the East Indies"
 je_br_east_indies_trade_reason: "Control trade in the East Indies"
 je_br_west_indies_trade: "Control trade in the West Indies"
 je_br_west_indies_trade_reason: "Control trade in the West Indies"
 je_control_nile: "Control Nile"
 je_control_nile_reason: "Our authority flows where the Nile flows. To rule Aegypt is not merely to hold the cities of the delta—it is to command the river from its mouth to its distant source. The Nubian kingdoms to the south remain beyond our reach—fractured, defiant, and vulnerable. As long as they remain independent, our southern frontier is exposed and our legacy incomplete. To secure the Nile Valley is to restore order, reclaim wealth, and fulfill the ancient mandate of Aegyptian rule. The river must flow under one banner—ours."
 je_restore_russia: "The Gathering of the Rus"
 je_restore_russia_reason: "Once, the lands of the Rus’ burned bright—princes ruled from snow-covered citadels, churches rang with Slavic chant, and riders watched the forests from wooden palisades. But that time is long past. The Mongol storm shattered the old unity. Now the land lies broken, scattered beneath foreign crowns and golden tribute. Novgorod and Pskov bend the knee to the north. The Ruthenian princes serve the will of the Commonwealth. And the rest—Muscovy among them—bow to Tartaria, passing coin up the chain like blood to a distant heart. But the memory of unity has not died. The dream of a single Russia, sovereign and whole, lingers in every hilltop kremlin and Orthodox bell tower. To realize that dream will take more than ambition—it will take strength, vision, and the will to defy the tribute-takers and false guardians alike. We must gather the scattered branches of Rus’ and make them a tree once more.."
 je_elysium_expand_01: "The Mandate of the West"
 je_elysium_expand_01_reason: "Once a distant outpost of the Basileía Romaíon, Elysium has since become something greater—a civilization reborn, forged in struggle, philosophy, and faith. Now, as its cities swell and its armies march, a question looms ever larger: shall we inherit this continent, or leave it to lesser powers? Some claim we are strangers in this land. But our blood, our law, our gods, and our tongue have taken root. We are no longer colonists—we are Elysians. The old world fractured. We endured. Now, the land opens before us, waiting not for conquest, but for unification. To falter now would betray our destiny."
 je_vineland_expand_01: "Claim of the Old Blood"
 je_vineland_expand_01_reason: "Our forefathers crossed the storm-wracked seas to escape the death of their gods and the fading of the old ways. They carved a home from ice and stone, fought beast and man alike, and gave us Vinland. Now, the ancient call of the land echoes once more—not to retreat, but to expand. Forest, fjord, and plain lie ahead, wild and vast, teeming with spirits both forgotten and reborn. Others may see wilderness; we see inheritance. The old blood stirs. The time has come to shape this land in our image, not by treaty, but by will."
 je_australis_expand_01: "Beneath a New Sun"
 je_australis_expand_01_reason: "Far from the marble halls of old empires and the myths of ancient seas, Antipodeia was born—not of conquest, but of vision. Here, under foreign constellations, a new world has taken shape, carried on the backs of settlers, philosophers, and exiles. Now the interior calls. The rivers run wide, the earth is rich, and the horizon dares us forward. Others may hesitate, divided by custom or fear. But we were not built to hesitate. The frontier is not a barrier—it is a beginning. This land is ours to unify, to cultivate, to illuminate."
 je_tartaria_steppe_expansion: "Steppe Expansion"
 je_tartaria_steppe_expansion_reason: "Expand Eastward further into the Steppe and Siberia."
 je_japanese_siberia_expansion: "Shiberia Expansion"
 je_japanese_siberia_expansion_reason: "Expand Deeper into Shiberia."
 je_persia_expansion_01: "Afganistan"
 je_persia_expansion_01_reason: "Our Control over the region has devolved into a patch work of autonomous Satrapies."
 je_persia_expansion_02: "Central Asia"
 je_persia_expansion_02_reason: "The Central Asian Khanates should be brought under direct Persian rule."
 je_consolidate_india_01: "Consolidate Rule"
 je_consolidate_india_01_reason: "Our Control over certain regions has been lost in all but name as Governors have entreched themselves."
 je_br_colonial_subject: "Colonial Subject"
 je_br_colonial_subject_reason: "We enjoy subsidies and protection of our mother country."
 je_br_new_world_colony: "Settlers and Soil"
 je_br_new_world_colony_reason: "Ours is a young land—scarcely settled, scarcely tamed. The cities are few, the fields are wide, and the people are still learning to call this place home. But within this vastness lies promise: untapped resources, fresh identity, and the freedom to shape a society without the burdens of the old world.Though distant from empire, we are not forgotten—we are becoming. For the next century, our mission is not conquest or completion, but cultivation."
 je_br_africa_colony: "Shores of Promise"
 je_br_africa_colony_reason: "To settle these shores is to test the will of nations. The land is rich, vast, and merciless—its rivers wide, its peoples proud, its heartlands still untamed. Colonies here do not grow in peace; they grow in challenge. But beneath the dust lies opportunity. Coastal outposts become trade hubs, distant valleys yield harvests, and cities may rise where once there was only stone and scrub. This is no easy beginning—but it may one day be remembered as a foundation that changed the world."
 je_br_independent_new_world_country: "Settlers and Soil"
 je_br_independent_new_world_country_reason: "Ours is a young land—scarcely settled, scarcely tamed. The cities are few, the fields are wide, and the people are still learning to call this place home. But within this vastness lies promise: untapped resources, fresh identity, and the freedom to shape a society without the burdens of the old world.Though distant from empire, we are not forgotten—we are becoming. For the next century, our mission is not conquest or completion, but cultivation."
 je_br_inward_perfection: "Inward Perfection"
 je_br_inward_perfection_reason: "We have shut ourselves off from foreign peoples and their ideas, perhaps its time to open up and modernize?"
 je_tartaria_modernize: "The Winds of Change"
 je_tartaria_modernize_reason: "Our ancestors ruled on horseback, their word law from the grasslands to the mountains. We were feared, swift, and unconquered. But the world no longer bows to the rider or the sword. It now belongs to machines, to coin, to cities that never sleep. Tartaria stands at a crossroads, to cling to our old ways is to risk decay; to embrace reform is to risk our soul. But if we do not act—if we do not modernize—then we will not lead, we will follow. And Tartaria was not born to follow."
 je_tartaria_end_slavic_oppression: "End Slavic Oppression"
 je_tartaria_end_slavic_oppression_reason: "We should stop Oppressing our Slavic and other minorities so that they may contribute to our growth."
 je_br_mediterranean_merchant_republic: "Merchant Republic"
 je_br_mediterranean_merchant_republic_reason: "Our Republic stands strong, admired by the world for all we have achieved. However, our advantages are not eternal. It is crucial that we safeguard our edge, as our rivals seek to undermine everything we have built."
 je_br_colonial_merchant_republic: "Colonial Merchant State"
 je_br_colonial_merchant_republic_reason: "Colonial Merchant State"
 je_br_baltic_toll_collection_rights: "Control over Baltic trade"

 je_br_tithe_profits: "Alms of St Peter"
 je_br_tithe_profits_reason: "Peter's Pence (or Denarii Sancti Petri and "Alms of St Peter") are donations or payments made directly to the Holy See of the Catholic Church."
 je_restore_north_italy: "Unite Italia settentrionale"  
 je_restore_north_italy_reason: "The northern heart of Italia remains fractured—city-states, republics, duchies, and principalities all clinging to old rivalries, old borders, and old ambitions.
