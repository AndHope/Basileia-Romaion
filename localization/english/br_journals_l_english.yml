 veiled_exarchate_aegypt: "The Exarchate Aegypt"
 veiled_exarchate_africa: "The Exarchate Africa"
 veiled_exarchate_italy: "The Katepaníkion Italia"
 je_veiled_exarchate: "The Exarchate of Aegypt"
 je_veiled_exarchate_reason: "Our influence in Aegypt has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Exarchate. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."
 je_veiled_exarchate2: "The Exarchate of Africa"
 je_veiled_exarchate2_reason: "Our influence in Africa has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Exarchate. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."
 je_veiled_exarchate3: "The Katepaníkion of Italia"
 je_veiled_exarchate3_reason: "Our influence in Italia has grown considerably, yet our power in the region is dependent on our relations with the breakaway Katepaníkion. By reestablishing formal dominion over the country, our domination would be assured."

 palaiologos_reforms.1.t: "Palaiologos Renaissance"
 palaiologos_reforms.1.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is in a period of steady decline. If we do not reassert [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] sovereignty and reclaim our place among the Powers of the world, we risk catastrophe."
 palaiologos_reforms.1.f: "O Basileus, our empire confronts numerous challenges, yet an opportunity lies before us to rejuvenate our former glory. The Varangians, staunch upholders of the old order resistant to change for centuries, have been overthrown. Our decline since the days of the Macedonian revival and the remarkable Komnenoi restoration, during which we regained dominion over the Balkans, Aegypt, North Africa, and Italia, our fortunes have waned. The corruption prevalent in preceding feeble dynasties has caused the empire to disintegrate and fragment. Influential Dynatoi families have seized your authority, undermining the state for their own gain. Latinoi merchants, granted extensive privileges, have monopolized significant sectors of our economy. Once our mightiest and most loyal assets, the Varangians have betrayed us by selling off the Imperial purple to the highest bidder, enriching themselves and eliminating any ruler attempting to reform the deeply rooted corruption. A substantial undertaking lies ahead of us. We must suppress rebellions and reinforce our control over the Exarchates that have broken away. The Varangians must be replaced with a modern army capable of defending our territories. Furthermore, we must strive to restore the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to its former glory as the epitome of civilization.Our primary focus will be on education, urbanization, and sovereignty. It is time for the Palaiologos Renaissance to usher in a new era of enlightenment and strength."
 palaiologos_reforms.1.a: "Great reform is needed."
 
 je_palaiologos_reforms_main: "Palaiologos Renaissance"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_main_reason: "Decades of decay threaten to consign [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] to obscurity. Through bold reforms in learning, industry, and governance, we shall kindle a new age of enlightenment—restoring our cities, reviving our armies, and reclaiming the imperial splendor that is our birthright."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_main_goal: "Complete 12 'Palaiologos' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 
 je_palaiologos_reforms_conquest: "Completion unlocks the Journal Entries 'The Palaiologos Refroms Reclaim Aegypt' 'The Palaiologos Refroms Reclaim Africa' 'The Palaiologos Refroms Reclaim Italia'"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_economy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Restoration of the Imperial Polis"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_economy_reason: "The majesty of Basileía Romaíon was once reflected in bustling fora, grand workshops, and gleaming aqueducts. Centuries of decline have left our cities half-forgotten and our industries stagnant. We must raise new bulwarks, revive artisan guilds, and kindle the furnaces of progress to rebuild the heart of the empire."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_economy_goal: "Double your GDP."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_education: "Palaiologos Reforms: Revival of the Logos"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_education_reason: "Letters, philosophy, and sacred lore formed the bedrock of our civilization, yet ignorance spreads like a pall over the provinces. We shall reopen the Great Schools of Constantinople, dispatch itinerant grammatikoi and rhetoroi, and breathe life once more into the libraries of Dionysiou and Magnaura."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_education_goal: "Increase literacy by 35%."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_separatism: "Palaiologos Reforms: Restoration of Imperial Unity"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_separatism_reason: "Our dominion has been fractured by wayward exarchates and restless dynatói. Let not the embers of rebellion ignite anew: we must bind every thema and katepanate to the purple, suppress insurrection, and reaffirm the indivisible unity of Basileía Romaíon."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_separatism_goal: "Maintain zero active separatist uprisings for a cumulative 30 years."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_security: "Palaiologos Reforms: Restore Thematic Order"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_security_reason: "Bandits and brigands now hold sway over our byways and hamlets, terrorizing peasants and merchants alike. We must sweep the countryside clean—re‑garrison the themata, scourge the outlaws from forest and vale, and restore the Pax Palaiologos to every field and village."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_land_reform: "Palaiologos Reforms: Pronoia Reform"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_land_reform_reason: "For generations the Dynatoi have hoarded the soil, forcing our peasants into serfdom beneath their shadow. It is time to dismantle these great Pronoia estates, redistribute the land to those who till it, and rekindle the promise of freeholders across the empire."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_curruption: "Palaiologos Reforms: Purge of Corruption"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_curruption_reason: "Corruption has seeped into every corner of the Basileía, enriching dynatói and guilds while draining the imperial treasury. To restore the honor of the crown and revive the people’s faith, we must root out graft and nepotism—even at the risk of angering those who profit most from decay."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_latin_privileges: "Palaiologos Reforms: Revocation of Latin Trade Privileges"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_end_latin_privileges_reason: "The Latin merchants, once indispensable allies in our time of need, now wield an undue monopoly over our ports and markets. These emergency concessions have become chains upon our commerce. We must annul their special rights and reassert Romaíon sovereignty over our own trade routes."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_west: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reintegration of the Balkan Themata"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_west_reason: "In the Greek heartland, powerful dynatói have carved the themata into semi‑independent fiefdoms, fracturing imperial authority. To secure our southern frontier and reaffirm the Basileus’s rule, these private estates must be dissolved and returned to direct oversight from Constantinople."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_east: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reintegration of the Anatolian Themata"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_centralization_east_reason: "Across Anatolia, entrenched magnates hold sway over vast estates, undermining the unity of the empire. To fortify our eastern borders and restore the indivisible rule of the purple, we must dissolve these dynastic domains and reestablish centralized administration."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_bureaucracy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reform the Bureaucracy"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_bureaucracy_reason: "The once-gilded machinery of imperial governance now groans beneath the weight of contradiction and decay. Competing logothetēs, corrupt sakellarioi, and provincial scribes rule like dynatoi, issuing decrees without seal or sanction. To restore order, we must cleanse the chancelleries, unify the tax rolls, and elevate a new generation of loyal functionaries. Let the ink flow as swiftly as the sword, and let the voice of the Basileus reach every corner of the realm."

 je_palaiologos_reforms_army: "Palaiologos Reforms: Tagmata Modernization"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_army_reason: "Though the Varangians have been disbanded, we still lack a reliable professional core. We must reorganize our Stratiótikoi into effective Tagmata, revitalize the thematic levy, and raise new λεγεῶνες to defend the Empire."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_navy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Nautikón Reform"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_navy_reason: "The navy has been long-neglected and is a hotbed of disloyalty. During our early wars with our rebellious Exarchates the Basilikon Karabisianoi Nautikón threatened to defect to the Aegyptians multiple times, and we are forced to rely on the support of the Latin powers to defend our coasts and the straits, the same latin powers which we now know were funding the inserection. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detachments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."


 je_palaiologos_reforms_syria: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reconquest of Syria"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_syria_reason: "Our Syrian provinces have languished under the Komnenian yoke, their cities defiled by usurping governors. By raising the imperial standard once more from Antioch to Damascus, we will restore the rightful dignity of the Basileía Romaíon and secure the Eastern frontier."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_egypt: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reconquest of Aegyptios"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_egypt_reason: "The Komnenoi clutch the Nile’s riches with borrowed coin and hollow titles. Their throne is but a fragment of empire. We must strike at their fortress in Alexandria and compel them to kneel before the one true Emperor, restoring our diadem’s light to the banks of the river of kings."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_africa: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reconquest of Africa"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_africa_reason: "The sands of North Africa once flowed with our authority, now dispersed by rebellion. To secure Rome’s legacy and the grain that feeds Constantinople, we must bring the Maghreb and its exarchate back under imperial command."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_italy: "Palaiologos Reforms: Reconquest of Italia"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_italy_reason: "Italia’s marble cities and fertile plains are the heart of our heritage. The breakaway Katepaníkion stands defiant—yet the Eagle of Rome must soar above Rome itself. We shall march upon Napoli and recover the lands that gave birth to empire."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_elysium: "Palaiologos Reforms: Recall of Elysium"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_elysium_reason: "Our distant colony of Elysium, founded by exiles and scholars, thrives beyond the sea—but drifts from our embrace. By reaffirming imperial patronage and extending the purple across the waves, we bind this new world once more to the Mother City."
 je_palaiologos_reforms_australis: "Palaiologos Reforms: Settlement of Antipódeia"
 je_palaiologos_reforms_australis_reason: "Though Antipódeia was born of our citizens’ venture, it remains beyond the formal fold of empire. We must grant it charter and garrison, forging this frontier into a steadfast bulwark of Romaíon civilization."
 

 palaiologos_reforms_syria_egypt: "Complete another Palaiologos Reform [concept_journal_entry] by owning the following states: Lower Egypt, Middle Egypt, Upper Egypt, and Sinai."

 finished_palaiologos_reforms_tt: "Has completed or failed the Palaiologos Renaissance [concept_journal_entry]"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.t: "Palaiologos Reforms: The Reorganization"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.desc: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully modernized and re-asserted itself on the world stage. A new era begins for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.f: "Behold the miracle wrought by our hand! Constantinople’s avenues now ring with the hum of looms and the clang of hammers, while marble academies rise beside triumphal arches. The Tagmata drill in gleaming new uniforms, and villages once given to toil have blossomed into teeming cities of light. Only decades past, our realm teetered on ruin, a target for overweening powers—and now those very courts come, not with swords drawn, but with envoys seeking our counsel. The Basileía stands reborn, its glory renewed. Blessed be the Lord, who has guided our work!"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.a: "The army could use additional reforms."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.b: "We should re-conquer the Balkans!"
 palaiologos_reforms.2.c: "Follow through with urbanization."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.d: "We will reap the benefits of education."
 palaiologos_reforms.2.e: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] runs on paper."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.t: "The Palaiologos Failure"
 palaiologos_reforms.3.d: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has failed to modernize and re-assert itself on the world stage. The vultures begin to circle as the last days of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] draw near."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.f: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] falls silent. Just days after announcing [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] intention to abdicate, most likely under the duress of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] ministers, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been found dead in [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] chambers. Much like our precious empire, the [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetPrimaryRoleTitle] had been suffering from a long, creeping sickness that ultimately made [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHim] unable to bear the weight of the crown. A broken and deranged shadow of [SCOPE.sCharacter('romaioi_sultan').GetHerHis] former self."
 palaiologos_reforms.3.a: "We belong to God, and to Him do we return."

 #PLC
 je_golden_liberty: "Golden Liberty"
 je_eastern_resistance: "The Eastern Troubles"
 je_golden_liberty_reason: "When the Golden Liberty of our Nobles’ Democracy was formed, it was seen as something ahead of its time, giving us the most liberal system in Europe, if not the world! But now, it has become a force to just preserve the status quo, with the Liberum Veto being the most blatant weapon for the Szlachta. We have to change our system, making it more fair, even expanding it if we can!"
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant Tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."
 
  #Moldova
 je_army_modernization: "Army reform and modernization"
 je_army_modernization_reason: "With potential enemies on all sides we need to start modernizing our army and build a local arms industry to protect and expand our interests in the Danubian Region."
 je_side_russia: "A Golden Offer"
 je_side_russia_reason: "Our efforts to reform and modernize have not gone unnoticed, the Golden Horde is preparing an offer for us, but what could they possibly want?"
 je_conquer_wallachia_dobruja: "Liberate Wallachia and Dobruja"
 je_conquer_wallachia_dobruja_reason: "With the Tatars backing we can now liberate Wallachia and Dobruja from the oppressive southern br_modifier_boyars and their Hungarian allies."
 je_form_greater_romania_mol: "Form Greater Vlachia"
 je_form_greater_romania_mol_reason: "With our unification completed, we must strive to unite all our brothers and sisters across the Carpathians and embark on a \"special military operation\" against the Hungarians to achieve our independence once and for all."

  #Wallachia
 je_little_union: "The Little Union"
 je_little_union_reason: "By abusing loopholes in our treaties with the Great Powers, it is possible to enter in a personal union with Moldavia by electing a ruler in both nations. The Powers will not like it, but they will be powerless to stop our march towards the Union."
 je_secure_dobruja: "War of Independence"
 je_secure_dobruja_reason: "The time has come to liberate Dobruja and gain our independence from the Hungarian Empire."
 je_form_greater_romania: "Form Greater Vlachia"
 je_form_greater_romania_reason: "Now with our independence secured we must strive to unite all our brothers and sisters across the Carpathians and the Pruth river."

  #HRE
 je_impending_revolution: "The Revolution"
 je_impending_revolution_reason: "The situation in the HRE has grown desperate and the people have had enough. If we don’t do anything then the situation could get out of control and our 1000 year government could be overthrown. We will have to consider carefully how to deal with the situation, do we reform the state or do we choose to suppress these so-called revolutionaries. In case we fail to do anything the consequences could be disastrous."
 finished_revolution_tt: "We have dealt with the revolution in a manner of our choice."
 je_revolution_reform: "Revolution: Reform"
 je_revolution_reform_reason: "The time has come to reform the state in order to halt a revolution."
 je_revolution_suppress: "Revolution: Suppress"

 br_enbraced_an_identity_tt: "We have chosen which identity to embrace."
 je_identity_embrace_our_roman_identity: "National Identity: Embrace our Roman Identity"
 je_identity_embrace_our_roman_identity_reason: "We are Roman first and foremost."
 je_identity_embrace_french: "National Identity: Embrace our French Identity"
 je_identity_embrace_french_reason: "We must abandon the Idea that we are Roman. We are French."
 je_roman_reconquest: "Roman Reconquest"

 je_roman_reconquest_goal: "We have completed all the Roman Reconquest journals."
 je_roman_reconquest_advance_tt: "Advances the Journal Entry 'Roman Reconquest'"
 je_retaking_the_heart_of_roman_civilization: "Roman Reconquest: Retaking the heart of Roman Civilization"

 #Flanders
 #je_control_the_lowlands_main
 je_control_the_lowlands_main: "Control the Lowlands"
 je_control_the_lowlands_main_goal: "Complete 2 'Lowland' [Concept('concept_journal_entry', '$concept_journal_entries$')]"
 je_control_the_lowlands_main_reason: "Since the Middle Ages, the lowlands have been one of the richest regions in Europe. Out of all the rivaling states, Flanders was the strongest. But a lot has changed since then, our French rulers are stronger than ever, and the days of small independent lords are over, so before we can break away from their domination, we must centralise and strengthen our control over the region."
 #je_control_the_northern_lowlands
 je_control_the_northern_lowlands: "Control the Northern Lowlands"
 #je_control_the_northern_lowlands_goal: "We must establish our control over the northern lowlands."

 #'Generic Journals'
 je_reclaim_england: "Reclaim England"  
 je_reclaim_england_reason: "Having secured our freedom, it's time to reclaim our rightful lands."  
 je_conquer_wales: "Subjugate Wales"  
 je_conquer_wales_reason: "Wales belongs under our banner!"
 je_reclaiming_aquitaine: "Annex Aquitaine"  
 je_reclaiming_aquitaine_reason: "Aquitaine rightfully belongs within our Empire."
 je_reclaiming_transylvania: "Annex Transylvania"
 je_reclaiming_transylvania_reason: "Transylvania must be fully reincorporated into our realm."
 je_reclaiming_armenia: "Restore Eastern Armenia"
 je_reclaiming_armenia_reason: "Eastern Armenia must be fully reincorporated into our realm."
 je_restore_serbia: "Restore the Serbian Realm"
 je_restore_serbia_reason: "Once an Exarchate under the shadow of the Basileía Romaíon, Serbia emerged into independence divided and vulnerable. Though the crown was claimed, true authority was scattered among petty princelings and marcher lords. Worse still, foreign powers imposed tribute upon our people, mocking our sovereignty. To restore Serbia’s dignity, we must bring these lands to heel and unite the realm under a single banner—our banner."

 je_br_gain_independence: "The Struggle for Sovereignty"
 je_br_gain_independence_reason: "We are ruled, but not governed. Bound by treaties, tributes, or the weight of foreign crowns, our people remain denied their rightful voice and destiny. The time has come to cast off the yoke. Whether through arms, diplomacy, or perseverance, we must seize our independence—not as a gift, but as a claim long delayed. No great nation was born free; it was made free."
 je_br_east_indies_trade: "Dominate East Indies Trade"
 je_br_east_indies_trade_reason: "The riches of the East—spices, silks, and exotic wares—flow through the Indies like lifeblood. To secure our place among the great trading powers, we must seize the ports, protect the sea lanes, and assert dominance over this vital crossroads of commerce."
 je_br_west_indies_trade: "Control West Indies Trade"
 je_br_west_indies_trade_reason: "The sugar islands and bustling harbors of the West Indies are a keystone of New World wealth. We must secure our foothold in the region, challenge rival merchants, and ensure our ships carry the lion’s share of its treasures home."
 je_control_nile: "Control Nile"
 je_control_nile_reason: "Our authority flows where the Nile flows. To rule Aegypt is not merely to hold the cities of the delta—it is to command the river from its mouth to its distant source. The Nubian kingdoms to the south remain beyond our reach—fractured, defiant, and vulnerable. As long as they remain independent, our southern frontier is exposed and our legacy incomplete. To secure the Nile Valley is to restore order, reclaim wealth, and fulfill the ancient mandate of Aegyptian rule. The river must flow under one banner—ours."
 je_restore_russia: "The Gathering of the Rus"
 je_restore_russia_reason: "Once, the lands of the Rus’ burned bright—princes ruled from snow-covered citadels, churches rang with Slavic chant, and riders watched the forests from wooden palisades. But that time is long past. The Mongol storm shattered the old unity. Now the land lies broken, scattered beneath foreign crowns and golden tribute. Novgorod and Pskov bend the knee to the north. The Ruthenian princes serve the will of the Commonwealth. And the rest—Muscovy among them—bow to Tartaria, passing coin up the chain like blood to a distant heart. But the memory of unity has not died. The dream of a single Russia, sovereign and whole, lingers in every hilltop kremlin and Orthodox bell tower. To realize that dream will take more than ambition—it will take strength, vision, and the will to defy the tribute-takers and false guardians alike. We must gather the scattered branches of Rus’ and make them a tree once more.."
 je_elysium_expand_01: "The Mandate of the West"
 je_elysium_expand_01_reason: "Once a distant outpost of the Basileía Romaíon, Elysium has since become something greater—a civilization reborn, forged in struggle, philosophy, and faith. Now, as its cities swell and its armies march, a question looms ever larger: shall we inherit this continent, or leave it to lesser powers? Some claim we are strangers in this land. But our blood, our law, our gods, and our tongue have taken root. We are no longer colonists—we are Elysians. The old world fractured. We endured. Now, the land opens before us, waiting not for conquest, but for unification. To falter now would betray our destiny."
 je_vineland_expand_01: "Claim of the Old Blood"
 je_vineland_expand_01_reason: "Our forefathers crossed the storm-wracked seas to escape the death of their gods and the fading of the old ways. They carved a home from ice and stone, fought beast and man alike, and gave us Vinland. Now, the ancient call of the land echoes once more—not to retreat, but to expand. Forest, fjord, and plain lie ahead, wild and vast, teeming with spirits both forgotten and reborn. Others may see wilderness; we see inheritance. The old blood stirs. The time has come to shape this land in our image, not by treaty, but by will."
 je_australis_expand_01: "Beneath a New Sun"
 je_australis_expand_01_reason: "Far from the marble halls of old empires and the myths of ancient seas, Antipodeia was born—not of conquest, but of vision. Here, under foreign constellations, a new world has taken shape, carried on the backs of settlers, philosophers, and exiles. Now the interior calls. The rivers run wide, the earth is rich, and the horizon dares us forward. Others may hesitate, divided by custom or fear. But we were not built to hesitate. The frontier is not a barrier—it is a beginning. This land is ours to unify, to cultivate, to illuminate."
 je_tartaria_steppe_expansion: "Expansion into the Steppe"
 je_tartaria_steppe_expansion_reason: "Beyond the rivers and ridgelines of our frontier lies the boundless grassland of the eastern steppe. To expand into Siberia is to reclaim the spirit of the riders—of the khans who once ruled from horizon to horizon. We must press eastward and restore the reach of Tartaria."
 je_japanese_siberia_expansion: "Shiberian Ambition"
 je_japanese_siberia_expansion_reason: "The cold, untamed expanse of Shiberia lies before us—rich in resources, distant from prying powers, and waiting for order. To secure this land is not only a matter of strategy, but a statement of strength. The Shogunate must move northward."
 je_persia_expansion_01: "The Eastern Marches"
 je_persia_expansion_01_reason: "Afghanistan, once the eastern shield of our empire, has drifted into disorder. Its satraps and chiefs act in defiance, and our writ carries little weight. If Persia is to reclaim its destiny, we must restore order to these windswept highlands and remind the east who holds the eternal flame."
 je_persia_expansion_02: "Echoes of Empire"
 je_persia_expansion_02_reason: "The deserts and oases of Central Asia once echoed with the banners of Persian kings. Though the khanates have taken root, they sprouted in soil that still remembers our name. The time has come to rekindle the legacy—to bring the steppe back beneath the shadow of the Peacock Throne."
 je_consolidate_india_01: "Consolidate the Provinces"
 je_consolidate_india_01_reason: "Many of our governors now rule like kings in their own right—entrenched, autonomous, and disloyal. If we are to be more than a court of titles and whispers, we must bring these wayward provinces back into the fold and restore central authority."
 je_br_colonial_subject: "Colonial Subject"
 je_br_colonial_subject_reason: "We enjoy the subsidies and protection of our mother country—but at the price of sovereignty. Whether this arrangement is a foundation for growth or a gilded chain remains to be seen."
 je_br_new_world_colony: "Settlers and Soil"
 je_br_new_world_colony_reason: "Ours is a young land—scarcely settled, scarcely tamed. The cities are few, the fields are wide, and the people are still learning to call this place home. But within this vastness lies promise: untapped resources, fresh identity, and the freedom to shape a society without the burdens of the old world.Though distant from empire, we are not forgotten—we are becoming. For the next century, our mission is not conquest or completion, but cultivation."
 je_br_africa_colony: "African Frontier"
 je_br_africa_colony_reason: "Across the sun-scorched coasts and river-carved interiors of Africa, we have planted outposts, missions, and fledgling towns. Yet our presence remains fragile—buffeted by local resistance, unfamiliar climates, and the sheer scale of the land. If we are to survive and thrive, we must cultivate our holdings, secure trade, and grow strong on this storied continent. The frontier awaits our ambition."
 je_br_independent_new_world_country: "Settlers and Soil"
 je_br_independent_new_world_country_reason: "Ours is a young land—scarcely settled, scarcely tamed. The cities are few, the fields are wide, and the people are still learning to call this place home. But within this vastness lies promise: untapped resources, fresh identity, and the freedom to shape a society without the burdens of the old world.Though distant from empire, we are not forgotten—we are becoming. For the next century, our mission is not conquest or completion, but cultivation."
 je_br_inward_perfection: "Inward Perfection"
 je_br_inward_perfection_reason: "For generations, we have stood apart—self-sufficient, refined, and untouched by the chaos beyond our borders. Foreign ideas have been kept at bay, and foreign powers held at arm's length. This policy of inward perfection has preserved our sovereignty—but at what cost? As the world changes, new technologies, doctrines, and powers rise beyond our walls. We must decide whether to remain steadfast in tradition or step cautiously toward the unfamiliar currents of modernity."
 je_tartaria_modernize: "The Winds of Change"
 je_tartaria_modernize_reason: "Our ancestors ruled on horseback, their word law from the grasslands to the mountains. We were feared, swift, and unconquered. But the world no longer bows to the rider or the sword. It now belongs to machines, to coin, to cities that never sleep. Tartaria stands at a crossroads, to cling to our old ways is to risk decay; to embrace reform is to risk our soul. But if we do not act—if we do not modernize—then we will not lead, we will follow. And Tartaria was not born to follow."
 je_tartaria_end_slavic_oppression: "End Slavic Oppression"
 je_tartaria_end_slavic_oppression_reason: "We should stop Oppressing our Slavic and other minorities so that they may contribute to our growth."
 je_br_mediterranean_merchant_republic: "Serene Merchant Republic"
 je_br_mediterranean_merchant_republic_reason: "From the marble halls of the Signoria to the bustling arsenals of the Grand Canal, our Republic stands as a beacon of commerce, culture, and cunning. For generations, the Doge and the Maggior Consiglio have steered our fate through war and wealth alike. But envy festers beyond our walls. To remain Serenissima, we must guard our trade routes, outwit rival powers, and ensure the lion of our Republic still roars across the waves."

 je_br_colonial_merchant_republic: "Colonial Merchant Dominion"
 je_br_colonial_merchant_republic_reason: "Chartered companies and merchant republics have carved out their own realms beyond the seas—colonial dominions ruled not by kings, but by coin. Through trade, diplomacy, and force, we must entrench our influence and ensure that our flag flies over every profitable port."
 je_br_baltic_toll_collection_rights: "Control over Baltic Trade"
 je_br_baltic_toll_collection_rights_reason: "The frigid waters of the Baltic Sea carry not only timber, furs, and amber—but power. By securing the chokepoints of this northern trade artery, we exert influence over every merchant fleet and warship that dares pass. The toll we collect is more than revenue; it is a reminder that commerce bends to sovereignty."
 je_br_strait_of_hercules: "Control over the Strait of Hercules"
 je_br_strait_of_hercules_reason: "Where the Pillars of Hercules rise, the world narrows. From the vast oceans to the inner sea, every vessel must pass this ancient gate. To hold it is to tax the ambitions of empires and kingdoms alike—gold flows to the one who commands the strait."
 je_br_bosphorus_strait_toll: "Control over the Bosphorus"
 je_br_bosphorus_strait_toll_reason: "The Bosphorus is no mere waterway—it is the spine of empire, linking two continents and two worlds. Grain, silk, and steel pass through its narrow veins. Those who hold the strait do not simply charge for passage—they shape the fate of trade and empire alike."
 je_br_klysma_canal_toll: "Control over the Klysma Canal"
 je_br_klysma_canal_toll_reason: "The Klysma Canal is our bridge between seas—an artery cut through the desert to bind the world of spice and silk to the heart of civilization. Every ship that passes owes its journey to our vision—and pays for the privilege."
 je_br_persian_strait_toll: "Control over the Persian Straits"
 je_br_persian_strait_toll_reason: "At the edge of the world’s oldest empires lies a passage narrow as a blade. The Persian Straits are the key to eastern wealth, and to hold them is to control the breath of trade from Hind to Arabia. Here, coin flows like current."
 je_br_hajj_profits: "Custodians of the Hajj"
 je_br_hajj_profits_reason: "To hold Mecca is to stand at the crossroads of faith. Each year, thousands make the sacred journey—bringing with them gold, goods, and tribute, whether in devotion or necessity. While the pilgrimage is a duty of the faithful, it is also a current of commerce that flows through our hands. As long as we safeguard the Holy City, we may ensure order… and draw profit from the faithful who walk the path of the Hajj."
 je_br_tithe_profits: "Alms of St Peter"
 je_br_tithe_profits_reason: "For centuries, the faithful have offered coin to the See of Peter—not merely as tribute, but as a symbol of devotion, obedience, and penitence. Known as Peter’s Pence, these offerings flow from kings and commoners alike, drawn from every corner of Christendom. To control these alms is to wield not just wealth, but influence—the quiet power of expectation, patronage, and forgiveness. In this world of fractured crowns and rising heresies, the treasury of the Church remains an anchor of authority."
 je_restore_north_italy: "Unite Italia settentrionale"  
 je_restore_north_italy_reason: "The northern heart of Italia remains fractured—city-states, republics, duchies, and principalities all clinging to old rivalries, old borders, and old ambitions. But the world is changing, and with it, the fortunes of fragmented nations. To secure our future, we must look beyond ancient divisions. From the Alpine passes to the Po Valley and the Adriatic coast, our strength lies in unity. If we are to thrive in the new century, we must bring all of Italia settentrionale under a single banner—our banner."  
 je_china_reforms_navy: "Naval Reform"
 je_china_reforms_navy_reason: "The navy is highly decentralized with each region commanding its own local navies. Renovating the navy by developing our officer corps, fielding new detachments and outfitting new, larger ships must be a priority."
