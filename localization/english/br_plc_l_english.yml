 #br_je_plc_succession
 br_je_plc_succession: "Succession"
 br_je_plc_succession_lobby: "Our King, Sigismund III, is slowly dying. We must prepare for the assention of his heir Princess Jadwiga."
 br_je_plc_succession_status: "We have currently reached #b #blue [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('br_plc_succession_acquired_reform_support_progress_var').GetFlagName]#!#! when it comes to reform support"
 br_je_plc_succession_reason: "Our King, Sigismund III, is slowly dying. For years, his health has been failing more and more, and by all rights, he is king in name only. While in reality, the Sejm has always had full power compared to our monarchs, there was once hope for it to change in Sigismund. Sigismund’s heir now holds that hope for reform, a bright and well educated young woman named after Poland’s first female monarch and Saint. It took much political maneuvering on Sigismund’s part to secure her as his heir. Now as the nation waits for the inevitable, support for Jadwiga should be built up to help both ease the transition of power and for the sake of helping get some initial reforms through.\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\nThe goal of this journal is to get the reform support as high as possible, when the [concept_journal_entry] comes at an end you will get bonuses based on how high the reform support is.\nYou can increase reform support by increasing the [concept_clout] of the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant]. While you have access to this journal you have also been given a special decree, the [GetDecreeType('br_decree_increase_jadwigan_support').GetName] decree, to help boost the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant]. Another way to increase support is to pass laws that are supported by the [GetIdeology('br_ideology_jadwigan_reformist').GetName] [concept_ideology].\n\nList of support tiers:\n#b #blue [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_minor_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_moderate_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_major_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_stunted_opposition').GetName]#!#!"
 #br_je_plc_reform_main
 br_je_plc_reform_main: "Commonwealth Reforms"
 br_je_plc_reform_main_lobby: "$br_je_plc_reform_main_desc$"
 br_je_plc_reform_main_desc: "With Queen Jadwiga now on the throne the work for reform can now begin. Two plans for reform have been proposed, the “Moderate” Reform path, proposed by various members of the Sejm who agree on some points of reform. Then there is the more radical “Jadwigan” Reform path, named for and proposed by her majesty and her supporters. In order for either plan to work, we must dedicate ourselves to one or the other. In a worst case scenario, if we do not finish either in a reasonable time our Commonwealth may end as we know it."

 br_je_plc_reform_main_on_fail_tt: "Opens the Reform/Reunify the Commonwealth button in Nation formation"
 br_je_plc_reform_main_on_timeout_tt: "No direct debuff, but due to the inaction, the autonomies will unilaterally declare independence, making so that any reunification has to be done militarily, either by a Unification Diplomatic Play, or either re-puppeting them/conquering them one at a time. Once all either don’t exist or are puppeted, a separated Commonwealth reformation button is allowed, but unlike the ones of the reform paths, there is no fanfare or real bonuses"
 #br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_1
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_1: "Jadwigan Reforms: Memories of the Slavic Slave Trade"
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_1_reason: "Though it ended centuries ago, the Slavic Slave Trade is still in our memory, it has created a unique hatred towards it within our culture. Afterall, it is the word Slav that the more modern Slave word comes from. Yet, we still practice it, but we call it Serfdom. Its defenders will try to say otherwise, but people are tied to the land of a lord. How is there a difference? It must be abolished, both for our modernization and for our morals!"
 #br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_2
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_2: "Jadwigan Reforms: Improving the Golden Liberty"
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_2_reason: "When the Golden Liberty of our Nobles’ Democracy was formed, it was seen as something ahead of its time, giving us the most liberal system in Europe, if not the world! But now, it has become a force to just preserve the status quo, with the Liberum Veto being the most blatant weapon for the Szlachta. We have to change our system, making it more fair, even expanding it if we can!"
 #br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_3
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_3: "Jadwigan Reforms: The Minorities of the Commonwealth"
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_3_reason: "One of our Reform points, though unpopular to many, was to end our policies of Polonization and to restore the strength of the Warsaw Confederation. We have many minorities in our lands, from Jews, Germans, Ruthenians, Russians, etc… They need to have their voices heard or risk separatism within our borders and our autonomies."
 #br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_4
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_4: "Jadwigan Reforms: A New Economic Model"
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_4_reason: "TODO."
 #br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_5
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_5: "Jadwigan Reforms: Military Reformation"
 br_je_plc_jadwigan_reform_5_reason: "TODO"
 #br_je_plc_moderate_reform_1
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_1: "Moderate Reform: Ending Feudalism"
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_1_reason: "The Feudalistic Model of Land Management has been slowly becoming more and more obsolete as the decades go by. But, we must be cautious as to not upset the Szlachta. Perhaps an option where the peasants are “free” but still work for their former lords."
 #br_je_plc_moderate_reform_2
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_2: "Moderate Reform: Streamlining the Sejm"
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_2_reason: "The fact that we have the Sejm has always been a unique part of our governance. Of the nations of Europe, we have been one of the few to have such a liberalized institution! But in recent years it has been stunted by the concept of the Liberum Veto. It has been used more and more as a way for the Szlachta to gain more power, now we must end this practice and reform the Sejm"
 #br_je_plc_moderate_reform_3
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_3: "Moderate Reform: Preventing another Failure at Hadiach"
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_3_reason: "Over a Century ago representatives from the various peoples of the Commonwealth went to negotiate the treatment of the various minorities of our nation. But it failed, and a revolt happened causing our current decentralized situation for our Commonwealth. We must try to negotiate again, in order to have hope to reunite the Commonwealth"
 #br_je_plc_moderate_reform_4
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_4: "Moderate Reform: An Outdated Economy"
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_4_reason: "Maintaining funding has always been difficult thanks to the systems of noble privileges that have only grown stronger over the years. But like everything else, we must go at the change slowly as to not upset the nobility and risk a revolt."
 #br_je_plc_moderate_reform_5
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_5: "Moderate Reforms: Military Reformation"
 br_je_plc_moderate_reform_5_reason: "One Universal truth both moderate reformers and full reformers can agree on is, our military needs to massively change. The levy system is becoming increasingly outdated, having a military system where we have at least a small amount of soldiers ready at all times would be preferable."
 #br_je_plc_reform_the_commonwealth
 br_je_plc_reform_the_commonwealth: "Reform the $dyn_c_commonwealth$"
 br_je_plc_reform_the_commonwealth_reason: "With the Jadwigan Reforms finished, we have shown to our constituent autonomies we are willing and able to change and make their peoples fully equal in the Commonwealth, no more of our favoritism to just our fellow Poles. We must now propose full reunification and bring our nation together once more!"
 br_plc_has_formed_the_commonwealth_tt: "Has formed the $dyn_c_commonwealth$"
 br_plc_has_not_formed_the_commonwealth_tt: "Has not formed the $dyn_c_commonwealth$"
 br_je_plc_reform_the_commonwealth_complete_tt: "$br_plc_has_formed_the_commonwealth_tt$"
 #br_je_plc_reform_the_commonwealth
 br_je_plc_centralizing_the_commonwealth: "Centralizing the $dyn_c_commonwealth$"
 br_je_plc_centralizing_the_commonwealth_reason: "With the moderates getting their way, we at least opened ourselves up to some change. Our Lithuanian brothers are once again equal to us, and we are on the road to modernization. It is time we centralize ourself and make the Commonwealth whole once more."
 br_je_plc_centralizing_the_commonwealth_complete_tt: "$br_plc_has_formed_the_commonwealth_tt$"
 #br_je_plc_reclaiming_the_baltic
 br_je_plc_reclaiming_the_baltic: "Reclaiming the Baltic"
 br_je_plc_reclaiming_the_baltic_lobby: "$br_je_plc_reclaiming_the_baltic_reason$"
 br_je_plc_reclaiming_the_baltic_reason: "After our War with Sweden a few decades ago, we lost all of our Baltic holdings with the exception of the Lithuanian homeland. It is time to correct this, we must end the Swedes hegemony over the Baltic Sea!"
