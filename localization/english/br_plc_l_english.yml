 #br_je_plc_succession
 br_je_plc_succession: "Succession"
 br_je_plc_succession_lobby: "Our King, Sigismund III, is slowly dying. We must prepare for the assention of his heir Princess Jadwiga."
 br_je_plc_succession_status: "We have currently reached #b #blue [GetPlayer.MakeScope.Var('br_plc_succession_acquired_reform_support_progress_var').GetFlagName]#!#! when it comes to reform support"
 br_je_plc_succession_reason: "Our King, Sigismund III, is slowly dying. For years, his health has been failing more and more, and by all rights, he is king in name only. While in reality, the Sejm has always had full power compared to our monarchs, there was once hope for it to change in Sigismund. Sigismund’s heir now holds that hope for reform, a bright and well educated young woman named after Poland’s first female monarch and Saint. It took much political maneuvering on Sigismund’s part to secure her as his heir. Now as the nation waits for the inevitable, support for Jadwiga should be built up to help both ease the transition of power and for the sake of helping get some initial reforms through.\n$TOOLTIP_DELIMITER$\nThe goal of this journal is to get the reform support as high as possible, when the [concept_journal_entry] comes at an end you will get bonuses based on how high the reform support is.\nYou can increase reform support by increasing the [concept_clout] of the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant]. While you have access to this journal you have also been given a special decree, the [GetDecreeType('br_decree_increase_jadwigan_support').GetName] decree, to help boost the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_intelligentsia',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant]. Another way to increase support is to pass laws that are supported by the [GetIdeology('br_ideology_jadwigan_reformist').GetName] [concept_ideology].\n\nList of support tiers:\n#b #blue [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_minor_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_moderate_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_major_support').GetName] | [GetStaticModifier('br_modifier_plc_succession_stunted_opposition').GetName]#!#!"
