 ##Events
 #A Revolution looms
 hre_revolution_events.1.t: "A Revolution looms"
 hre_revolution_events.1.d: "There is unrest within our Empire it has come to our attention that there may be a revolution brewing. If we don't do anything one of our estates may launch a revolution."
 hre_revolution_events.1.f: "Though our nation has always stood as the beacon of civilization and stability in the Christian parts of West Europe, issues continue to arise. Over time cracks have started to show as our military, economy, and our God given social structure continue to become more and more outdated. Furthermore, our autonomous vassals and colonies have been calling more and more for increased freedoms and even independence! But before we can truly focus outward, we must focus inward. Due to our internal issues, increasing unrest among the so-called Third Estate has put us under increased threat of revolution, and if one happens, we would be unable to truly stop it. In this, we have two possible solutions… We can either embrace some of these would be Revolutionaries ideas and reform our great nation and bring it into this increasingly liberalizing world, by granting freedoms, abolishing serfdom, and replacing our outmoded economic and military structures! Or… We can embrace our own reforms, and suppress these Godless liberals by modernizing our military, centralizing our government around God’s chosen Emperor of the Romans, and bringing our economy to a state of modernized Feudalism! In either of these solutions, we will have some push back among the First and Second Estates, but if we fail, and the patience of the people wanes, our monarchy and our way of life will be drastically and irrevocably altered… Regardless, one of our first possible steps will be to deal with our schism on our national identity in this world where national identity is growing in importance."
 hre_revolution_events.1.a: "We must address it."
 #The Revolution Erupts

However while the new government has solidified its rule over the capital it is yet uncertain if the rest of the country will loyally follow this new course for the nation, as many within the Empire still see the Emperor as the true legitimate ruler of the Empire.\nFor now the government is trying to uphold the illusion that the Emperor supports the revolution, so for the moment the Monarchy remains in place. However it is yet to be seen if the Emperor will truly back this new course or if he will simply try to undo the Revolution. So perhaps it would be better if there was no Monarchy and perhaps we should abolish this 1000 year antiquated system and return to the republic of old. Perhaps it would indeed be better if we followed in the footsteps of the old Romans and abolished the Monarchy to create a republic, this would perhaps be unpopular but the road to Enlightenment requires #r Sacrifices#!."
