 hre_revolution_events.201.t: "March on the Royal Residence"
 hre_revolution_events.201.d: "A large number of members of the 3de estate have decided to march on the [br_concept_imperial_residence]."
 hre_revolution_events.201.f: "At the Imperial Residence in $br_imperial_residence_building_loc$. The door of the Imperial chamber slams open, the Emperor looks up form his work visably irritated, to the man who just stormed in unannounced, the completely out of breath tries to speak. 'They're ... they're comming'. Early this morning a large mob of members of the 3de estate had gathered on a square in Paris. It started out as a simple protest for change, but it quickly escalated and now the protesters have decided to petition their demands directly to the Emperor. So now they are on their way, on their way to the Imperial Palace. The Emperor starts franticly pacing the room, what should he do, should he flee, should he call in the Military or should he try to negotiate with the mob."
 hre_revolution_events.201.a: "This does not look good."
 #Emperor can chose to cooperate with the mob or resist
 hre_revolution_events.202.t: "The Emperors choice"
 hre_revolution_events.202.d: "With the mob now infront of the [br_concept_imperial_residence], the Emperor must now choose what to do."
 hre_revolution_events.202.f: "The Emperor anxiously looks out the window at the mob infront of the palace, he can hear the calls of the crowd they are demanding he face them. Uncertain the Emperor looks across the room at the people standing around him, and he asks them what they think he should do. Almost immediately the commander of the guard steps forward tells him to let his men disperse the crowd, with violence if necessary, but that could make the situation only worse. Then his wife speaks up, she suggests he should go speak to the crowd and hear their pleas. But whatever happens it is the Emperors choice to make."
 hre_revolution_events.202.a: "Try to address the mob."
 hre_revolution_events.202.b: "Order the guards to disperse the mob."
 #The emperor attempts to speak to the crowd
 hre_revolution_events.203.t: "The Emperors speaks"

 hre_revolution_events.203.f: "From the balcony the Emperor looks out over the crowd, just now he had tried to calm them by speaking to the crowd, but it seems his words have fallen on deaf ears. By now the cries of the crowd have become deafening, the Emperor still tries to speak to them but nobody can hear him anymore. They have even started trowing objects at the balcony, the Emperor realizes he has lost all favor with the crowd. Realising that he is out of options the Emperor has decided to surrender himself to the leaders of the crowd who have claimed to represent the 3de estate."
 hre_revolution_events.203.a: "The Emperor surrenders himself."
 #The emperor orders the crowd dispersed
 hre_revolution_events.204.t: "The guards attempt to disperse the crowd"
 hre_revolution_events.204.d: "The Imperial guards attempts to disperse the crowd but they quickly lose control, the mob starts violently fighting back and manages to break into the [br_concept_imperial_residence], seizing the Imperial Family."
 hre_revolution_events.204.f: "The Imperial guards attempts to disperse the crowd, at first peacefully, but it quickly becomes obvious that the protesters are not going to back down. On the contrary the mob is pushing forward attempting to enter the Palace. It is in this chaos that eventually calamity strikes, someone fires a shot, no one knows who fired it, but that does not matter. Before anyone can diffuse the situation the guard believing to be under attack fire into the crowd, at which point all hell breaks loose and full scale fighting erupts infront of the Palace. Many are killed, but eventually the mob manages to overwhelm and kill the guards. From above the Emperor looks on in horror as the situation desolves, he knows the situation is inescapable. So when the mob, which has at this point transformed into a full scale revolution, breaks down the doors and forces their way into the Imperial chambers, the Emperor surrender himself to them."
 hre_revolution_events.204.a: "The Emperor surrenders himself."
 #The emperor moves to paris
 hre_revolution_events.205.t: "The Emperors moves"
 hre_revolution_events.205.d: "The [br_concept_imperial_residence] is currently located in $br_imperial_residence_building_loc$, but now that the revolutionaries have seized the imperial family they have decided that they will be moved back to $br_original_imperial_residence_building_loc$ in the center of Paris where they can keep an eye on him."
 hre_revolution_events.205.f: "The Imperial family had previously moved to $br_imperial_residence_building_loc$ outside of the city of Paris so they where removed form the unreast and instability of the city, but now the revolutionaries want them to return to the city, so they can show that the Monarchy is under the control of the new revolutionary regime."
 hre_revolution_events.205.a: "The Monarchy returns to Paris."

 #A revolutionary council of the 3de estate conviens and drafts a constitution
 hre_revolution_events.207.t: "A Constitution, the Revolution has begun"
 hre_revolution_events.207.d: "Today a revolutionary council of the 3de estate has conviened and has drafted a constitution, with this they have officially overthrown the previous regime and established their own, the #bold Revolution#! has now truly begun."
 hre_revolution_events.207.f: "As of now there is a new government in Paris, this new Revolutionary government has pledged to change the country and transform it into a enlightent and modern nation. However while the new government has solidified its rule over the capital it is yet uncertain if the rest of the country will loyally follow this new course for the nation, as many within the Empire still see the Emperor as the true legitimate ruler of the Empire.\nFor now the government is trying to uphold the illusion that the Emperor supports the revolution, so for the moment the Monarchy remains in place. However it is yet to be seen if the Emperor will truly back this new course or if he will simply try to undo the Revolution. So perhaps it would be better if there was no Monarchy and perhaps we should abolish this 1000 year antiquated system and return to the republic of old. Perhaps it would indeed be better if we followed in the footsteps of the old Romans and abolished the Monarchy to create a republic, this would perhaps be unpopular but the road to Enlightenment requires #r Sacrifices#!."
