 # events for Consolidate the Stato da Màr
 br_venice_events.20.t: "The Venetian Gazetteer"
 br_venice_events.20.d: "The Atlantican Courant has been successfully established, the first major newspaper in our colonies. While currently filled with shipping schedules and commodity prices, its editorial page has begun to gently favor Venetian interests."
 br_venice_events.20.f: ""Your Excellencies, for centuries, our galleys have carried the silks of the East and the gold of the West. But I propose a new cargo, one far more potent: the written word. The press is a new kind of ship, gentlemen, a fleet of thought that sails on the tides of reason. It carries not spices or silks, but ideas. And ideas, once landed on the shores of men's minds, can conquer a continent without a single musket being fired. All they require is the wind of your support in their sails."\n\n--Giovanni Battista Rosso, addressing the Council of Ten" 
 br_venice_events.20.a: "Provide a generous subsidy from the treasury."
 br_venice_events.20.b: "Purchase the paper and install a government editor."
 br_venice_events.20.c: "Grant the Church a dedicated column for scripture and homilies."

 br_venice_events.99.t: "The Roar Heard Across the Sea"
 br_venice_events.99.d: "The Stato da Màr is secure. Through a masterful blend of reform, diplomacy, and resolve, we have reforged our Atlantican possession into a loyal and prosperous cornerstone of the Republic."
 br_venice_events.99.f: "The work is done. The grumbling has ceased, the flags fly true, and the Lion of St. Mark now watches over a colony reborn. In the grand piazzas of L'Avana, they speak Venetian with pride; in the halls of the Grand Council, Atlantican representatives take their advisory seats. \n\n We did not break them. We did not abandon them. We remade them in our image, and in doing so, have created a power that will echo across the centuries. The Serene Republic is no longer just a European power, it is an Atlantic empire."
 br_venice_events.99.a: "The Mercantile Crown shall never dip from our Brow!" 
 br_venice_events.99.b: "Atlantica will become our breadbasket!"
 br_venice_events.99.c: "All who live under Venetian rule shall prosper."

 br_venice_events.100.t: "The Lion's Share"
 br_venice_events.100.d: "The question of Atlantican sovereignty has been answered by the sword. The colony is no more; its lands are now direct possessions of the Serene Republic."
 br_venice_events.100.f: "They challenged our rule, and we have shown them the cost. The Governor's Palace now houses a Venetian magistrate. Their militias are disbanded, their separate identity suppressed. What was once a reconciliation become a conquest. The land is ours, but the people's hearts are not. We have gained territory at the cost of creating a sullen, resentful populace that will require a heavy hand to govern for generations."
 br_venice_events.100.a: "A necessary action to ensure stability."

 br_venice_events.101.t: "The Lost Lion"
 br_venice_events.101.d: "We have lost the Stato Da Már. Through misrule, weakness, or sheer misfortune, our Atlantican possession has slipped from our grasp, a humiliating blow to the Republic's prestige and power."
 br_venice_events.101.f: "The dream is dead. The reports are final. The Lion has been torn down. Whether by a formal declaration of independence or a slow, bureaucratic death, our influence is ended. The ships that once carried wealth now carry only bitter memories. In the cafes of Venice, they speak of the one that got away, the great failure of our age. Our rivals laugh, our subjects doubt us, and a new power now wages war across the sea."
 br_venice_events.101.a: "Such is the cost of ambition."

 br_venice_events.104.t: "The Creeping Schism"
 br_venice_events.104.d: "Though avoiding a revolution, La Serenissima failed to properly consolidate the colonial government of Atlantica before its own culture and systems of governance became entrenched, creating a permanent rift between Venice and her colony."
 br_venice_events.104.f: "Two decades of commissions, debated reforms, and bureaucratic indecision have only served to yield alienation. While the Council deliberated, Atlantica grew into its own. Its merchants forged independent networks, its planters learned self-governance, and its people forged a new identity. The bonds of culture and commerce remain, but they have been stretched thin. The colony we once held is now a separate entity, bound to us by history and necessity, but no longer by unquestioned loyalty."
 br_venice_events.104.a: "A partnership, then, is preferable to a quarrel."
 br_venice_events.104.b: "Their ingratitude will not be forgotten."
