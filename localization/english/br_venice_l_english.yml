 # Crisis Events
 br_venice_events.1.t: "Unrest in L'Avana"
 br_venice_events.1.d: "Corruption and sedition fester in our Atlantican colony, threatening to tear it from our grasp."
 br_venice_events.1.f: "The grim reports from our colonial Provveditore leave little room for optimism. A shipment of tax revenue has vanished without a trace en route to the treasury, and the Magistrate of St. Augustine has been found dead in his manor, an event the local guard are quick to label a tragic accident. From his office in L'Avana, the Provveditore writes of a garrison grumbling over back-pay and Amerigan elites who now openly whisper of 'self-governance.' The fragile structure we built is cracking. We must choose how to brace it before it collapses entirely."
 br_venice_events.1.a: "The garrison will be paid from our own coffers."
 br_venice_events.1.b: "We shall grant placate them with an advisory seat on the council."
 br_venice_events.1.c: "This is a matter for our auditors to resolve."

 br_venice_events.2.t: "Auditors Uncover Graft"
 br_venice_events.2.d: "Our patient investment in a thorough audit has borne fruit, uncovering a conspiracy and recovering the stolen revenue."
 br_venice_events.2.f: "The Provveditore's agents, working with quiet diligence, have traced the missing tax shipment to a conspiracy between a colonial magistrate and a disgraced Venetian captain. The funds have been recovered and the conspirators arrested, demonstrating the formidable reach of the Republic's justice."
 br_venice_events.2.a: "Let this be a lesson to all."

 br_venice_events.3.t: "Auditors Stir Resentment"
 br_venice_events.3.d: "Our heavy-handed audit has concluded, leaving a wake of resentment but no uncovered conspiracy."
 br_venice_events.3.f: "The Provveditore's agents seized ledgers without cause and leveled public accusations based on rumor, convincing the Atlanticans that Venetian rule is arbitrary and unjust. We have found no corruption, but we have successfully manufactured a fresh grievance for colonial agitators to rally around."
 br_venice_events.3.a: "A regrettable necessity."

 br_venice_events.4.t: "Whispers in the Piazza"
 br_venice_events.4.d: "Loyalists in Atlanteum report that a radical Atlantican group plots to desecrate the statue The Patrician and the Pearl, a potent symbol of Venetian authority in the city."
 br_venice_events.4.f: "Our informants in the Atlantican taverns and markets bring troubling news. A group, calling themselves the "Sons of the Shore," speak of the statue as an insult, a bronze depiction of their subjugation, with our Patrician forever taking the pearl from the diver at his feet. Their intention is to shatter this hierarchy, literally and symbolically."
 br_venice_events.4.a: "The garrison will be stationed around the clock."
 br_venice_events.4.b: "Have it quietly removed for “restoration”."
 br_venice_events.4.c: "It is mere bluster. We will not be provoked."

 br_venice_events.5.t: "The Perla Square Shooting"
 br_venice_events.5.d: "Protests turned bloody when our soldiers fired upon a crowd attempting to deface the monument, leaving the symbol of our rule spattered with blood."
 br_venice_events.5.f: "The "Sons of the Shore" did not back down. A crowd gathered at the monument, first throwing jeers, then rocks. As the situation escalated, a young man scaled the base with a pot of black paint. A nervous soldier, fearing an attack on his officer, fired his musket. \n\nThe single shot sparked a volley into the crowd. The statue now tells a darker story. The pristine pearl is chipped from a stray bullet. The Patrician's fine robes are streaked with black paint and rust-brown stains. A local pamphleteer has already dubbed it "The Martyr's Fountain," and the square where it stands has been cordoned off."
 br_venice_events.5.a: "Lock down the city!"
 br_venice_events.5.b: "Clean off the stains and cover it up."
 br_venice_events.5.c: "In times like these we must turn to God."

 br_venice_events.6.t: "The Ghost in the Piazza"
 br_venice_events.6.d: "Our covert attempt to remove the statue failed, resulting in the Patrician's figure being stolen by protestors, leaving an empty plinth as a monument to our humiliation."
 br_venice_events.6.f: "Our plan was discovered. As our men attempted to disassemble the monument under the veil of night, they were ambushed by the "Sons of the Shore." After a brief, chaotic scuffle, the Atlanteans overwhelmed our workmen and made off with the central statue. \n\nWhere the Patrician once stood, there is only a stark, empty space. The diver still offers his pearl upwards, but now to nothing. A popular joke now circulates in the markets: "The Patrician was so shamed by the theft, he walked into the sea himself." Our authority has been made a laughingstock."
 br_venice_events.6.a: "Search Every Building in the City!"
 br_venice_events.6.b: "Commission a new, grander monument."
 br_venice_events.6.c: "Craft a cheap replica. They won't know the difference."

 # Development Events
 br_venice_events.20.t: "The Venetian Gazetteer"
 br_venice_events.20.d: "The Atlantican Courant has been successfully established, the first major newspaper in our colonies. While currently filled with shipping schedules and commodity prices, its editorial page has begun to gently favor Venetian interests."
 br_venice_events.20.f: ""Your Excellencies, for centuries, our galleys have carried the silks of the East and the gold of the West. But I propose a new cargo, one far more potent: the written word. The press is a new kind of ship, gentlemen, a fleet of thought that sails on the tides of reason. It carries not spices or silks, but ideas. And ideas, once landed on the shores of men's minds, can conquer a continent without a single musket being fired. All they require is the wind of your support in their sails."\n\n--Giovanni Battista Rosso, addressing the Council of Ten" 
 br_venice_events.20.a: "Provide a generous subsidy from the treasury."
 br_venice_events.20.b: "Purchase the paper and install a government editor."
 br_venice_events.20.c: "Grant the Church a dedicated column for scripture and homilies."
 # completion/timeout/failure events
 br_venice_events.99.t: "The Roar Heard Across the Sea"
 br_venice_events.99.d: "The Stato da Màr is secure. Through a masterful blend of reform, diplomacy, and resolve, we have reforged our Atlantican possession into a loyal and prosperous cornerstone of the Republic."
 br_venice_events.99.f: "The work is done. The grumbling has ceased, the flags fly true, and the Lion of St. Mark now watches over a colony reborn. In the grand piazzas of L'Avana, they speak Venetian with pride; in the halls of the Grand Council, Atlantican representatives take their advisory seats. \n\n We did not break them. We did not abandon them. We remade them in our image, and in doing so, have created a power that will echo across the centuries. The Serene Republic is no longer just a European power, it is an Atlantic empire."
 br_venice_events.99.a: "The Mercantile Crown shall never dip from our Brow!" 
 br_venice_events.99.b: "Atlantica will become our breadbasket!"
 br_venice_events.99.c: "All who live under Venetian rule shall prosper."

 br_venice_events.100.t: "The Lion's Share"
 br_venice_events.100.d: "The question of Atlantican sovereignty has been answered by the sword. The colony is no more; its lands are now direct possessions of the Serene Republic."
 br_venice_events.100.f: "They challenged our rule, and we have shown them the cost. The Governor's Palace now houses a Venetian magistrate. Their militias are disbanded, their separate identity suppressed. What was once a reconciliation become a conquest. The land is ours, but the people's hearts are not. We have gained territory at the cost of creating a sullen, resentful populace that will require a heavy hand to govern for generations."
 br_venice_events.100.a: "A necessary action to ensure stability."

 br_venice_events.101.t: "The Lost Lion"
 br_venice_events.101.d: "We have lost the Stato Da Már. Through misrule, weakness, or sheer misfortune, our Atlantican possession has slipped from our grasp, a humiliating blow to the Republic's prestige and power."
 br_venice_events.101.f: "The dream is dead. The reports are final. The Lion has been torn down. Whether by a formal declaration of independence or a slow, bureaucratic death, our influence is ended. The ships that once carried wealth now carry only bitter memories. In the cafes of Venice, they speak of the one that got away, the great failure of our age. Our rivals laugh, our subjects doubt us, and a new power now wages war across the sea."
 br_venice_events.101.a: "Such is the cost of ambition."

 br_venice_events.104.t: "The Creeping Schism"
 br_venice_events.104.d: "Though avoiding a revolution, La Serenissima failed to properly consolidate the colonial government of Atlantica before its own culture and systems of governance became entrenched, creating a permanent rift between Venice and her colony."
 br_venice_events.104.f: "Two decades of commissions, debated reforms, and bureaucratic indecision have only served to yield alienation. While the Council deliberated, Atlantica grew into its own. Its merchants forged independent networks, its planters learned self-governance, and its people forged a new identity. The bonds of culture and commerce remain, but they have been stretched thin. The colony we once held is now a separate entity, bound to us by history and necessity, but no longer by unquestioned loyalty."
 br_venice_events.104.a: "A partnership, then, is preferable to a quarrel."
 br_venice_events.104.b: "Their ingratitude will not be forgotten."
