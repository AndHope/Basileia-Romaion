 # Crisis Events
 br_venice_events.1.t: "Unrest in L'Avana"
 br_venice_events.1.d: "Corruption and sedition fester in our Atlantican colony, threatening to tear it from our grasp."
 br_venice_events.1.f: "The grim reports from our colonial Provveditore leave little room for optimism. A shipment of tax revenue has vanished without a trace en route to the treasury, and the Magistrate of St. Augustine has been found dead in his manor, an event the local guard are quick to label a tragic accident. From his office in L'Avana, the Provveditore writes of a garrison grumbling over back-pay and Amerigan elites who now openly whisper of 'self-governance.' The fragile structure we built is cracking. We must choose how to brace it before it collapses entirely."
 br_venice_events.1.a: "The garrison will be paid from our own coffers."
 br_venice_events.1.b: "We shall grant placate them with an advisory seat on the council."
 br_venice_events.1.c: "This is a matter for our auditors to resolve."

 br_venice_events.2.t: "Auditors Uncover Graft"
 br_venice_events.2.d: "Our patient investment in a thorough audit has borne fruit, uncovering a conspiracy and recovering the stolen revenue."
 br_venice_events.2.f: "A single sheet of paper, left on the Provveditore's desk. The wax seal is black.\n\n"The matter of the missing treasury shipment is concluded. The parties have been reminded of their obligations to the Republic, and will commit no further crimes. The funds are restored. Do not let this happen again.""
 br_venice_events.2.a: "Let this be a lesson to all."

 br_venice_events.3.t: "Auditors Stir Resentment"
 br_venice_events.3.d: "Our heavy-handed audit has concluded, leaving a wake of resentment but no uncovered conspiracy."
 br_venice_events.3.f: "They took your books too?"\n\n"Threw them in the street. A lifetime of honest trade, soaked in the mud. For what?" \n\n"For show. To prove they have the power. They don't care if the books are clean. They only care that we remember who can take them."
 br_venice_events.3.a: "A regrettable necessity."

 br_venice_events.4.t: "Whispers in the Piazza"
 br_venice_events.4.d: "Loyalists in Atlanteum report that a radical Atlantican group plots to desecrate the statue The Patrician and the Pearl, a potent symbol of Venetian authority in the city."
 br_venice_events.4.f: "Our informants in the Atlantican taverns and markets bring troubling news. A group, calling themselves the "Suns of the Shore," speak of the statue as an insult, a bronze depiction of their subjugation, with our Patrician forever taking the pearl from the diver at his feet. Their intention is to shatter this hierarchy, literally and symbolically."
 br_venice_events.4.a: "The garrison will be stationed around the clock."
 br_venice_events.4.b: "Have it quietly removed for “restoration”."
 br_venice_events.4.c: "It is mere bluster. We will not be provoked."

 br_venice_events.5.t: "El Masacre de la Perla"
 br_venice_events.5.d: "Protests turned bloody when our soldiers fired upon a crowd attempting to deface the monument, leaving the symbol of our rule spattered with blood."
 br_venice_events.5.f: "The Suns of the Shore did not back down. A crowd gathered at the monument, first throwing jeers, then rocks. As the situation escalated, a young man scaled the base with a pot of black paint. A nervous soldier, fearing an attack on his officer, fired his musket. \n\nThe single shot sparked a volley into the crowd. The statue now tells a darker story. The pristine pearl is chipped from a stray bullet. The Patrician's fine robes are streaked with black paint and rust-brown stains.
 br_venice_events.5.a: "Lock down the city!"
 br_venice_events.5.b: "Clean off the stains and cover it up."
 br_venice_events.5.c: "In times like these we must turn to God."

 br_venice_events.6.t: "The Ghost in the Piazza"
 br_venice_events.6.d: "Our covert attempt to remove the statue failed, resulting in the Patrician's figure being stolen by protestors, leaving an empty plinth as a monument to our humiliation."
 br_venice_events.6.f: "Our plan was discovered. As our men attempted to disassemble the monument under the veil of night, they were ambushed by the Suns of the Shore. After a brief, chaotic scuffle, the Atlanteans overwhelmed our workmen and made off with the central statue. \n\nWhere the Patrician once stood, there is only a stark, empty space. The diver still offers his pearl upwards, but now to nothing. A popular joke now circulates in the markets: "The Patrician was so shamed by the theft, he walked into the sea himself." Our authority has been made a laughingstock."
 br_venice_events.6.a: "Search Every Building in the City!"
 br_venice_events.6.b: "Commission a new, grander monument."
 br_venice_events.6.c: "Craft a cheap replica. They won't know the difference."

 br_venice_events.7.t: "The Shame of Atlanteum"
 br_venice_events.7.d: "We failed to act, and the protestors have publicly and thoroughly defaced the monument, carving a message of finality into its base."
 br_venice_events.7.f: "They dared. Under the light of day, the Suns of the Shore swarmed the Patrician and the Pearl. They were not stopped.\n\n When they departed, the Admiral's pointing hand was broken off, the charter in his other hand was replaced with a hangman's noose, and the inscription "NVNC ET SEMPER" had been chiseled away, replaced with a single, crude word: "FINIS." The message could not be clearer."
 br_venice_events.7.a: "The Patrician Must Come Down."
 br_venice_events.7.b: "Seal off the Piazza."
 br_venice_events.7.c: "We must live with our failure."

 br_venice_events.8.t: "The Ransacked Pearl"
 br_venice_events.8.d: "Our soldiers have turned the city of Atlanteum upside down in a desperate search for the stolen statue, only seeding resentment through their means."
 br_venice_events.8.f: "Under martial decree, doors have been splintered, warehouses ransacked, and merchants dragged from their beds for questioning. The Patrician remains missing, but every shattered lock and torn-up floorboard only serves to curdle people's fears into cold resentment for the Republic.  The merchants whose ledgers we seized and the laborers whose homes we violated, once divided by class, can now find some unity in a common, simmering anger."
 br_venice_events.8.a: "We cannot stop and embarrass ourselves now."
 br_venice_events.8.b: "This is causing more harm than the statue is worth. Call off the search."

 br_venice_events.9.t: "The Statue in the Sawdust"
 br_venice_events.9.d: "After months of fruitless searching, the location of the Patrician has finally been revealed. This discovery was not made by our soldiers, but revealed through a traitor amongst the thieves."
 br_venice_events.9.f: ""Your Excellencies," the message from Provveditore Foscari reads, "a shipwright, one Luca Contarini, fearful for his business and his life, came to us in the dead of night. The Suns of the Shore sawed the Patrician apart on the very stones of the square, hiding the bronze within a false wall in a workshop facing the very square it once dominated. It was a masterpiece of humiliation, hidden in plain sight all along.""
 br_venice_events.9.a: "Melt it down. We will erase this humiliation."
 br_venice_events.9.b: "Restore it to its plinth. Our authority must be reaffirmed."

 br_venice_events.10.t: "The Pearl Bearer"
 br_venice_events.10.d: "Our commission for a replacement for the lost Patrician and the Pearl is complete."
 br_venice_events.10.f: ""The Pearl Bearer" is far grander than the statue it replaces. On a stepped stone plinth, a muscular Atlantican pearl diver is cast in bronze, straining to lift an enormous pearl above his head in a gesture of offering or triumph. Behind him stands a smaller figure of a Venetian patrician, one hand extended to rest upon the diver's shoulder in a pose that could be read as guidance, support, or restraint."
 br_venice_events.10.a: "Install it in Perla Square. This is a useful new narrative."
 br_venice_events.10.b: "Bring it to Venice. Let this marvel adorn the Piazza San Marco."

 br_venice_events.11.t: "The Replica's Shame"
 br_venice_events.11.d: "Our use of a cheap replica has been catastrophically exposed. The Sons of the Shore have produced the true statue, parading it through the streets of Atlanteum as a triumphant symbol of our deceit."
 br_venice_events.11.f: "From the personal log of Sergeant Valerio of the Colonial Garrison \n\n"They've made a mockery of our mockery. The replica's head is mounted on a post outside the customs house. A beggar's bowl is nailed beneath it, filled with a handful of lead tokens painted gold. Fake coins for our fake Patrician. Scrawled on a plank in tar: "SPARE A DUCAT FOR A BROKEN REPUBLIC?" \n\nThe Arsenale's mark is still visible on the inside of the plaster neck. My men see it. The merchants see it. There's no order I can give that will scrape this shame off our boots."
 br_venice_events.11.a: A devastating blow to our prestige.

 # Development Events
 br_venice_events.20.t: "The Venetian Gazetteer"
 br_venice_events.20.d: "The Atlantican Courant has been successfully established, the first major newspaper in our colonies. While currently filled with shipping schedules and commodity prices, its editorial page has begun to gently favor Venetian interests."
 br_venice_events.20.f: ""Your Excellencies, for centuries, our galleys have carried the silks of the East and the gold of the West. But I propose a new cargo, one far more potent: the written word. The press is a new kind of ship, a fleet of thought that requires no wood or cannon. It carries not spices, but ideas. And ideas, once landed on the shores of men's minds, can conquer a continent without a single musket being fired. Let our rivals invest in armies. There is no form of warfare that can hope to compete."\n\n --Giovanni Battista Rosso, addressing the Great Council of Venice"
 br_venice_events.20.a: "Provide a generous subsidy from the treasury."
 br_venice_events.20.b: "Purchase the paper and install a government editor."
 br_venice_events.20.c: "Grant the Church a dedicated column for scripture and homilies."
 # completion/timeout/failure events
 br_venice_events.99.t: "The Roar Heard Across the Sea"
 br_venice_events.99.d: "The Stato da Màr is secure. Through a masterful blend of reform, diplomacy, and resolve, we have reforged our Atlantican possession into a loyal and prosperous cornerstone of the Republic."
 br_venice_events.99.f: "The work is done. The grumbling has ceased, the flags fly true, and the Lion of St. Mark now watches over a colony reborn. In the grand piazzas of L'Avana, they speak Venetian with pride; in the halls of the Grand Council, Atlantican representatives take their advisory seats. \n\n We did not break them. We did not abandon them. We remade them in our image, and in doing so, have created a power that will echo across the centuries."
 br_venice_events.99.a: "The Mercantile Crown shall never dip from our Brow!" 
 br_venice_events.99.b: "Atlantica will become our breadbasket!"
 br_venice_events.99.c: "All who live under Venetian rule shall prosper."

 br_venice_events.100.t: "The Lion's Share"
 br_venice_events.100.d: "The question of Atlantican sovereignty has been answered by the sword. The colony is no more; its lands are now direct possessions of the Serene Republic."
 br_venice_events.100.f: "They challenged our rule, and we have shown them the cost. The Governor's Palace now houses a Venetian magistrate. Their militias are disbanded, their separate identity suppressed. The potential for reconciliation has been replaced by conquest. The land is ours, but the people's hearts are not. We have gained territory at the cost of creating a sullen, resentful populace that will require a heavy hand to govern for generations."
 br_venice_events.100.a: "A necessary action to ensure stability."

 br_venice_events.101.t: "The Lost Lion"
 br_venice_events.101.d: "We have lost the Stato Da Már. Through misrule, weakness, or sheer misfortune, our Atlantican possession has slipped from our grasp, a humiliating blow to the Republic's prestige and power."
 br_venice_events.101.f: "The dream is dead. The reports are final. The Lion has been torn down. Whether by a formal declaration of independence or a slow, bureaucratic death, our influence is ended. The ships that once carried wealth now carry only bitter memories. In the cafes of Venice, they speak of the one that got away, the great failure of our age. Our rivals laugh, our subjects doubt us, and a new power now wages war across the sea."
 br_venice_events.101.a: "Such is the cost of ambition."

 br_venice_events.104.t: "The Creeping Schism"
 br_venice_events.104.d: "Though avoiding a revolution, La Serenissima failed to properly consolidate the colonial government of Atlantica before its own culture and systems of governance became entrenched, creating a permanent rift between Venice and her colony."
 br_venice_events.104.f: "Two decades of commissions, debated reforms, and bureaucratic indecision have only served to yield alienation. While the Council deliberated, Atlantica grew into its own. Its merchants forged independent networks, its planters learned self-governance, and its people forged a new identity. The bonds of culture and commerce remain, but they have been stretched thin. The colony we once held is now a separate entity, bound to us by history and necessity, but no longer by unquestioned loyalty."
 br_venice_events.104.a: "A partnership, then, is preferable to a quarrel."
 br_venice_events.104.b: "Their ingratitude will not be forgotten."
