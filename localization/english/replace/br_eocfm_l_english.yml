 eocfm.001.d: "As the world enters a new age, scholars and state leaders have begun to debate the role of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetStateReligion.GetName] Church within the state. Some push for full state control of the Church, like Basileía Romaíon and Russians, while others advocate a more hands-off approach, with fears that such influence might invite a new form of oppression."
 eocfm.001.f: "The Eastern Orthodox traditon has diverged heavily from the Roman Catholic tradition in the West. Having rejected the primacy of Rome in Church affairs, the Orthodox Church is led by five Partiarchs, four at the Ancient Seats of Kōnstantinoúpolis, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem, with a fifth seated in Moscow. However, with the rise of Nationalism, states have sought increased control over ecclesiastical affairs."
 eocfm.004.d: "The Eastern Orthodox Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown to become one of the largest and most influential of the Patriarchates of the Eastern Church."
 eocfm.004.f: "Basil II, of Basileía Romaíon, encouraged Vladimir I to convert to Christianity, offering a marriage alliance with his sister, Anna. Vladimir, ruling Kievan Rus' from 980 to 1015, is renowned for Christianizing the territory. Despite early pagan traditions, Vladimir's envoys found Orthodox Christianity in Kōnstantinoúpolis particularly compelling. Negotiations led to Vladimir's baptism and marriage to Anna in 988, solidifying the region's Christian faith and political alliance with Basileía Romaíon. Upon returning to Kiev, Vladimir baptized his family and the people, marking a significant religious transformation known as the Baptism of the Rus"
 eocfm.010.f: "With the ebb and flow of Patriarchal influence over the church at large, minor differences have developed within the Orthodox church that have often led to minor schisms. While this may upset more traditionalist segements of the clergy, many argue that the Church structure is as much at risk of disintegration as that of the Basileus."
 eocfm.031.f: "Historical Note: Dating back to antiquity, many positions within Church leadership were appointed by the state. This practice was additionally normalized under both Romaíon and Russian rule. However, this practice often risked damaging the credibility of the clergy and kept the Church open to political meddling."
 eocfm.101.d: "In the face of resistance by the Patriarchs, the church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has successfully separated its ecclesiastical administration from that of Kōnstantinoúpolis. Seeking to avoid further fractures in the Eastern church, the Ecumenical Partiarch, [SCOPE.sCharacter('eocfm_constantinople_patriarch_scope').GetFirstName], has recognized our autonomy within the fabric of the church."
 eocfm.103.f: "It might be seen as a technicality by the non-Orthodox Christians, but this will help insulate us from further interference by the Romaíon state."
 eocfm.105.d: "Following immense efforts by our clergy, the Excharcate of Bulgaria, orginally a fabrication on the order of the Basileus, has been recognized as the one true Church of the Bulgarian nation."
 eocfm.111.d: "In an arrogant assertion of their authority, [SCOPE.sCountry('eocfm_usurper_scope').GetName] has cemented their control over the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Kōnstantinoúpolis. The previous administration has been deposed and replaced with one more amenable to their new overlords."
 eocfm.111.f: "While nominally separate from the government, the various patriarchal seats have been subject to heavy state influence as far back as antiquity continuing into the current age."
 eocfm.113.f: "While nominally separate from the government, the various patriarchal seats have been subject to heavy state influence as far back as antiquity continuing into the current age."
 eocfm.115.f: "While nominally separate from the government, the various patriarchal seats have been subject to heavy state influence as far back as antiquity continuing into the current age."
 eocfm.117.f: "While nominally separate from the government, the various patriarchal seats have been subject to heavy
 eocfm.119.f: "While nominally separate from the government, the various patriarchal seats have been subject to heavy state influence as far back as antiquity continuing into the current age."
 eocfm.120.f: "The ecumenical council has long been the primary method of resolving issues regarding the doctrine and administration of the Church. Since the split with Rome, the Eastern Councils have primarily taken place in Kōnstantinoúpolis, far from the overbearing influence of the Pope."
 eocfm.129.t: "The Romaíon Commonwealth"
 eocfm.140.f: "The Orthodox churches, have enjoyed relative independence from direct state administration. Any attempt to directly subordinate the church to political administration is bound to draw detractors."
 ocfm.141.f: "For centuries the ecclesiastic structure has remained inflexible, contributing it its slow decay under the Romaíon rule. In taking a fragment of the church under our care, we have the chance to reinvigorate the faith."
 eocfm.160.f: "The Church has served as the common force holding the peoples of the Balkans together. By seeking "divine" approval, our leaders can instill confidence in our governance."
 eocfm.168.d: "The Basileus has issued a firman deposing the Ecumenical Patriarch. Whatever his reasons, this has disrupted the orderly functioning of the Church at large."
 eocfm.168.f: "While the Patriarch may been selected from within the Orthodoxy, his reign remains subject to the approval of the Basileus."
 eocfm.171.f: "From the Septuagint to the Julian calendar, the Orthodoxy clings to its traditions."
 eocfm.180.d: "[GetReligion('orthodox').GetName] traditionalists have staged an enourmous march in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] demanding that the state put an end the heresey of schism with Kōnstantinoúpolis, or at least grant them "safeguards" against "state-sponsored nihilism"."
 eocfm.180.a: "The only future for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is one free of Kōnstantinoúpolis."
 eocfm.181.d: "As the Church of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] continues to distenangle itself from the ecclesiarchy of Kōnstantinoúpolis, both bishops and scholars have questioned what the role of the church will be within the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state with many arguing that it should serve the cause of #yellow Nationalism#!."
 eocfm.183.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('eocfm_patriarch_event_scope').GetFirstName], the Patriarch of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetCustom('eocfm_seat_event_type')] has condemned the heresey of unilateral schism with Kōnstantinoúpolis."
 eocfm.184.d: "[GetCulture('greek').GetName] Phanariot bishops in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] have caused an uproar by imposing Greek as the primary language in both school and religions. The church is the only means by which our [GetCulture('eocfm_primary_culture_scope').GetName] language has survived Romaíoi domination. Should they have their way, the very idea of a [GetCulture('eocfm_primary_culture_scope').GetName] state may be swept to the wind."
 eocfm.184.a: "Request that the Basileus right this travesty."
 eocfm.184.b: "We shouldn't challenge the primacy of Kōnstantinoúpolis."
 eocfm.185.d: "In defense of our [GetCulture('eocfm_primary_culture_scope').GetName] identity, [GetCulture('greek').GetName] bishops have been subjected to incredible harassment by both clergy and layperson alike. Slowly but surely, bishop after bishop has returned to Romaíoi lands to seek friendlier appointments. It may serve us well to better organize these efforts."
 eocfm.185.f: "The [GetCulture('eocfm_primary_culture_scope').GetName] churchs have been firmly under the control of Kōnstantinoúpolis. As a means of suppressing our identity, they have systematically blocked the appointment of native-[GetCulture('eocfm_primary_culture_scope').GetName] bishops to our lands.
 eocfm.188.d: "[SCOPE.sCharacter('eocfm_denouncing_agitator_scope').GetFullName], a staunch advocate for the supremacy of the Church, has denounced the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFlag] state in its intent to seize control of the Church from Kōnstantinoúpolis. Supporters of [concept_autocephaly] have demanded that his future speaking events be cancelled."
 eocfm.189.d: "Several shots rang out in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] as a prominent member of the [GetInterestGroupVariant('ig_devout',GetPlayer).GetNameWithCountryVariant] was assassinated for openly endorsing the schism from Kōnstantinoúpolis. Politicians and bishops alike have demanded increased protections for the clergy."
