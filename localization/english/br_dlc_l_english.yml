 dlc_basileia_romaion_desc: "Set over a century before the familiar age of industry, this is an era of awakening: of steam and scripture, of conquest and reform, of fading traditions and revolutionary fire. It is a time when legacies are reforged, when borders shift and faiths evolve, and where the clash of ideals defines the course of civilization. Inspired by Roman glory, medieval splendor, and Renaissance ambition, Basileía Romaíon invites you to reshape a living, breathing world. Depth, balance, and historical imagination lie at its core."
