 romaioi_startup_events.2.d: "Lore of Basileía Romaíon."
 romaioi_startup_events.2.f: "The Battle of Manzikret was one of the most pivotal moments in the history of the Basileía Romaíon. The Romaíoi, led by their Basileus, faced off against the Seljuks, a powerful Turkic dynasty that had risen to prominence in the region. The battle was fierce and bloody, with both sides suffering heavy losses. But in the end, neither side was able to claim a decisive victory. Instead, the two sides signed a peace treaty, with the Seljuks agreeing to recognize the sovereignty of the Basileía Romaíon over Anatolia and Armenia, and the Romaíoi recognizing the Seljuks' control over Persia and Mesopotamia. With the peace treaty in place, the Seljuks turned their attention to capturing Baghdad, the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate. The Abbasids, caught off guard by the sudden attack, were forced to flee to Mecca, where they had spent the last few centuries reestablishing their authority over all of Arabia. As the Basileía Romaíon continued to expand its power and influence throughout Europe, the Basileus set his sights on the Normans of southern Italy. The Normans, fierce warriors from the north, had established a powerful kingdom in the region, and the Basileus knew that in order to secure his western frontier, he would have to subjugate them. The Basileus assembled a powerful army and set out to conquer the Normans. The battle was fierce, but in the end, the superior tactics and resources of the Basileía Romaíon proved to be too much for the Normans to handle. The Normans were defeated and their kingdom was absorbed into the empire. With the western frontier secure, the Basileus was able to turn his attention to the instability of the Fatamid Caliphate. The Fatamids, a Shia Islamic dynasty that ruled over Egypt, the Levant and North Africa, were in the midst of a power struggle, and the Basileus saw an opportunity to reconquer these regions for the Basileía Romaíon. The Basileus launched a massive campaign to retake the Levant, Egypt and North Africa. The campaign was long and brutal, but in the end, the Basileía Romaíon emerged victorious. The Fatamids were defeated and the regions were once again under the control of the Basileus. As the Basileía Romaíon struggled to maintain control over the newly conquered regions of the Levant, Egypt and North Africa, it became increasingly difficult to keep the peace. The people of these regions had grown accustomed to the Fatamid rule and resented the new administration imposed by the Basileus. To quell the unrest, the Basileus was forced to grant more and more autonomy to these regions over the centuries. This autonomy allowed the people to govern themselves, but it also meant that the Basileus had less control over these regions. Over time, the autonomy granted to these regions grew until they were de facto independent. The Basileus, who was occupied with other matters, had to accept that these regions were no longer under his direct control and the Basileía Romaíon's influence in these regions became limited. When word reached the Romaíon that the Norse had discovered a new continent across the western ocean, the Romaíon leaders knew they had to act fast. They assembled a large expedition, consisting of ships, soldiers, and settlers, with the intent to establish a new colony in the new world. They named this colony Elysium, after the ancient Greek concept of a perfect paradise. The colony prospered in the new land, with the settlers quickly adapting to the new environment and forming a new identity as Elysians. They built homes, farms, and towns, and traded with the native peoples they encountered. The colony grew in size and strength, and soon became a thriving community. But as the years passed, war broke out between the Romaíon and Al Andalus, a powerful empire to the south. The Romaíon leaders were forced to divert resources and soldiers to the war effort, and as a result, Elysium was cut off from the mother country. Despite this, the Elysians did not despair. They knew they were on their own, and they embraced their independence. They established their own government and laws, and continued to build and expand their colony. They traded with other nations and formed alliances, and soon they were a powerful nation in their own right. Years went by and the war ended, but the Elysians did not return to the Romaíon, they had formed a new identity and new way of life. They had found their own Elysium, a new world where they could live free and prosper."

 # Palaiologos Reforms Events

 palaiologos_events.1.t: "The Pronoia System"
 palaiologos_events.1.d: "For centuries our administration has depended on tax farming for collecting revenue, but this highly inefficient system leaves much to be desired. Proposals for reform have flooded the Basileus desk, and the nation eagerly awaits our response."
 palaiologos_events.1.f: "Ever since the reign of Alexios II, taxation rights have been auctioned off to the highest bidder, who in turn retain a part of the revenue for personal use. Over time, this has created a cadre of powerful, autonomous, and oftentimes corrupt [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting], significantly reducing state revenues.\n\nWhile most agree that the system must change, few agree on how, and fewer still want to antagonize the Dynatói elite."
 palaiologos_events.1.a: "Abolish tax farming, but leave the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('governors').GetNameNoFormatting] in place."
 palaiologos_events.1.b: "Let sleeping dogs lie."
 palaiologos_events.1.c: "Abolish the system in fact as well as in name."
 pronoia_abolished: "Pronoia Abolished"

 palaiologos_events.2.t: "An Romaíon Land Code"
 palaiologos_events.2.d: "Our existing system of land ownership is old, inconsistent, and in dire need of reform. Proponents of modernization demand action; how shall the Basileus respond?"
 palaiologos_events.2.f: "Land ownership in the Basileía Romaíon is a complicated affair, consisting of an overlapping patchwork of tenured and communal lands, tax-exempt villages, grants of conquest, and a slew of other land categories. Recognizing the current situation's negative impact on state administration and revenue, key figures in Konstantinople push for reform. \n\nFearing conscription and increased taxation however, the Dynatói are sure to disapprove of any change to the status quo. "
 palaiologos_events.2.a: "Reform the system, but recognize traditional land categories."
 palaiologos_events.2.b: "The old system has served us well."
 palaiologos_events.2.c: "Enact a truly modern land code."
 palaiologos.2.tt1: "Dynatói might resist the reform."

 palaiologos_events.3.t: "The Themata System"
 palaiologos_events.3.d: "For centuries consolidation of land to powerful Dynatói, has eruded the Themata system of Farmer-Soldiers the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service has long disapeared, being replaced by vast Dynatói estates worked by peasants."
 palaiologos_events.3.f: "One of the distinctive features of the Themata system is the practice of granting land to soldiers in exchange for their military service. This system of land grants, known as \"pronoia\", will once again be integral to our defense strategy. It will encourage recruitment, ensure the availability of a standing army, and allow for the efficient mobilization of troops when necessary. These farmer-soldiers and their families will not only serve as the backbone of the military but also contribute to agricultural productivity in their regions during times of peace."
 palaiologos_events.3.a: "Restore the Themata System."
 palaiologos_events.3.b: "Prioritize the Tagmata."
 palaiologos_events.3.c: "Maintain Dynatói privileges."

 palaiologos_events.4.d: "With our move towards a more professional bureaucratic system in motion, demands have been put forth to nominally elevate the legal status of non-Romaíoi, enabling them to serve as civil servants."
 palaiologos_events.4.f: "The preservation of the Basileía Romaíon in the face of unrest, insurrection, and foreign intervention is a, if not the, primary concern of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]. If we are to achieve this however, steps to appease our minority subjects might be necessary, lest they become pawns of malicious foreign powers."
 palaiologos_events.4.a: "Equal rights under the law! On paper at least."
 palaiologos_events.4.b: "Promise reform, but let us not get carried away."
 palaiologos_events.4.c: "These are mere concessions masqueraded as reform. Denied!"

 palaiologos_events.5.d: "A climate of paranoia has enveloped the city of [SCOPE.sState('paranoia_state_scope').GetCityHubName], after the Patriarch accused the [SCOPE.sReligion('discriminated_religion_scope').GetName] community of conspiring with [SCOPE.sCountry('neighbor_country').GetName] to undermine the authority of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle]."
 palaiologos_events.5.f: "\"Are God's adversaries to be the equal of Christ? Some corrupt bureaucrats in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetCityHubName] may think so, but we true believers know better. As we speak, the unbelievers in our midst are busy plotting our doom, conspiring with their foreign masters to carve up our great empire like the confectioner carves up baklava.\""
 palaiologos_events.5.a: "They are just rumors, right?"

 palaiologos_events.6.f: "\"They came, wielding sticks and clubs — no-doubt egged on by some militant local preacher. Only some bruises and material damage so far, thank God, but I do not like the look of that crowd over by the western gate.\""
 palaiologos_events.6.a: "This is for the local governor to handle."
 palaiologos_events.6.b: "Muster the army, intervene immediately."
 palaiologos_events.6.c: "Let the mob run its course."

 palaiologos_events.8.d: "A sense of normalcy has returned to the streets of [SCOPE.sState('orderrestored_state_scope').GetCityHubName]. Storefronts are being rebuilt and restocked, and statements of distrust and hatred are gradually being replaced with ones of reconciliation."
 palaiologos_events.8.f: "\"The bastards ruined my store and insulted my name! But at the very least that was the extent of my injury. My son saw at least two of the men who partook in the riot dragged away by soldiers, apparently outed by their own community. Perhaps there is some justice to be found here after all. Now pass me the sugar, this tea is as bitter as uncured olives.\""
 palaiologos_events.8.a: "God Thanks!"

 palaiologos_events.9.f: "\"For two hundred years my family has owned this land; paying our dues as we have according to tradition.

 palaiologos_events.10.t: "Drafting non-Romaíoi"
 palaiologos_events.10.d: "With the establishment of a military draft, the state must now decide the role, if any, of non-Romaíoi in our army."
 palaiologos_events.10.f: "The Empire's non-Romaíoi subjects have traditionally been exempt from military service, substituting their blood with a special tax paid to the Basileus. Proponents of army modernization have now suggested the extension of the draft to all Romaíon subjects, however, this would rob the imperial coffers of an important source of income."
 palaiologos_events.10.a: "Those who can afford it may pay a draft exemption tax."
 palaiologos_events.10.b: "The draft applies to all subjects, regardless of creed."

The Confederation of Warsaw made us the first nation to enact religious freedoms, and no other nation in the Old World has as liberal of a constitution as we do. But, we are not without our problems. Internally, the Golden Liberty that helped found our system has increasingly impeded us with the Liberum Veto, and the nobles ever needing placated now have privileges that harm us economically, politically, and even militarily. There has even been a growing movement in the nobility, Sarmatism, looking to undo much of what our nation is known for. Externally, the Swedes, ever competing with their North Sea cousins are attempting to gain supremacy in the Baltic Sea; the Muscovites are now looking to reconsolidate its territory after their failed rebellion against the Golden Horde; and the Golden Horde itself, forever our enemy, always waiting to strike back after we expelled them from Poland during the 3rd Mongol Invasion of Poland!
