Basileía Romaíon 1736
Welcome to an alternative world one hundred years earlier than base Victoria 3 where many divergent events led to a drastically different world. Primarily inspired by Roman, Medieval and Renaissance History. Combined with game-play focused on realistic simulation and balance inspired by the great Victoria 2 mods as well as Project Caesar/EU5.

The term "Basileia Romaion" (Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων) is the Greek name for the Eastern Roman Empire or "Byzantine" Empire. It was the official name of the empire in Greek during its existence. "Basileia" means "Empire" or "Kingdom," and "Romaion" means "of the Romans" or "Roman." This name reflects the "Byzantines" identification as Romans and their continuity with the Roman Empire.
