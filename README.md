[h1]Basileía Romaíon 1736 [/h1] [b]Set over a century before the familiar age of industry, this is an era of awakening: of steam and scripture, of conquest and reform, of fading traditions and revolutionary fire. It is a time when legacies are reforged, when borders shift and faiths evolve, and where the clash of ideals defines the course of civilization. Inspired by Roman glory, medieval splendor, and Renaissance ambition, Basileía Romaíon invites you to reshape a living, breathing world. Depth, balance, and historical imagination lie at its core.[/b]

The term "Basileia Romaion" (Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων) is the Greek name for the Eastern Roman Empire or "Byzantine" Empire. It was the official name of the empire in Greek during its existence. "Basileia" means "Empire" or "Kingdom," and "Romaion" means "of the Romans" or "Roman." This name reflects the "Byzantines" identification as Romans and their continuity with the Roman Empire.
