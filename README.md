Basileía Romaíon 1736
Welcome to an alternative world one hundred years earlier than base Victoria 3 where many divergent events led to a drastically different world. Primarily inspired by Roman, Medieval and Renaissance History.

The term "Basileia Romaion" (Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων) is the Greek name for the Eastern Roman Empire or Byzantine Empire. It was the official name of the empire in Greek during its existence. "Basileia" means "Empire" or "Kingdom," and "Romaion" means "of the Romans" or "Roman." This name reflects the Byzantines' self-identification as Romans and their continuity with the Roman Empire.
