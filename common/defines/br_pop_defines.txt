### Pop Growth Constants
## Base Values per month
@min_birthrate = 0.00130 #was 0.00055			# Minimum base birthrate per month (at POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
@max_birthrate = 0.00400 #was 0.00450			# Maximum base birthrate per month (at SOL = 0 if not modified by malnourishment)
@min_mortality = 0.00120 #was 0.00045			# Minimum base mortality per month (at POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
@max_mortality = 0.00600 #was 0.00600			# Maximum base mortality per month (at SOL = 0 if not modified by malnourishment)

## SoL Thresholds
@pop_growth_equilibrium_sol = 5		# Equilibrium is pops stop starving and where growth first becomes positive
@pop_growth_transition_sol = 11 #was 10     # Transition determines how long birthrate "lags" behind mortality before starting to drop. Setting to same as equilibrium leads to no "lag" (only matters for birthrate)
@pop_growth_max_sol = 15 #was 20			# Growth Max is where net growth generally is at it's highest (only matters for mortality)
@pop_growth_stable_sol = 22 #was 30			# Stable is where birthrate and mortality stop changing and hit their minimum values

## Others
@transition_birthrate_mult = 1.1 #was 1 		# If you want the birthrate "lag" to go to a higher or lower value than max_birthrate. (you can also just change it directly below)
@max_growth_mortality_mult = 0.465 #was 0.35	# What proportion of birthrate_at_growth_max mortality should be at. Higher means lower growth

### Pop Growth Derived values
# Generally, for each one of these derived values below we're really just doing one of three operations (or combination of them):
# - Calculate a Point: sol * slope + start_value   					(x_at_y)
# - Calculate a Slope: (start_value - end_value) / number_of_steps	(x_slope)
# - Calculate an Intercept: -slope*sol + end_value					(x_intercept)
# Intercepts are only needed for line segments that don't start at 0 SoL

@birthrate_at_transition = @[max_birthrate*transition_birthrate_mult]
@rate_at_equilibrium = @[pop_growth_equilibrium_sol*((birthrate_at_transition-max_birthrate)/pop_growth_transition_sol)+max_birthrate] # determines both mortality and birthrate

## Mortality from 0 to pop_growth_equilibrium_sol

## Birthrate from 0 to pop_growth_transition_sol

# was @birthrate_pretransition_slope = @[(birthrate_at_transition-rate_at_equilibrium)/pop_growth_transition_sol] ; formula fixed

## Mortality from pop_growth_equilibrium_sol to pop_growth_max_sol

@mortality_at_growth_max = @[birthrate_at_growth_max*max_growth_mortality_mult]

@mortality_equilibrium_to_growth_max_intercept = @[-mortality_equilibrium_to_growth_max_slope*pop_growth_equilibrium_sol+rate_at_equilibrium]

## Birthrate from pop_growth_transition_sol to pop_growth_stable_sol
@birthrate_transition_slope = @[(min_birthrate-birthrate_at_transition)/(pop_growth_stable_sol-pop_growth_transition_sol)]
@birthrate_transition_intercept = @[-birthrate_transition_slope*pop_growth_stable_sol+min_birthrate]

### Pseudo algorithm to determine base Mortality / Birthrate
## Mortality

# else if (sol < POP_GROWTH_MAX_SOL)
# { mortality = sol * POP_GROWTH_MORTALITY_EQUILIBRIUM_TO_GROWTH_MAX_SLOPE + POP_GROWTH_MORTALITY_EQUILIBRIUM_TO_GROWTH_MAX_INTERCEPT }
# else if (sol < POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
# { mortality = sol * POP_GROWTH_MORTALITY_GROWTH_MAX_TO_STABLE_SLOPE + POP_GROWTH_MORTALITY_GROWTH_MAX_TO_STABLE_INTERCEPT }
# else { mortality = POP_GROWTH_MIN_MORTALITY }

## Birthrate
# if (sol < POP_GROWTH_EQUILIBRIUM_SOL)
# { birthrate = (sol * POP_GROWTH_BIRTHRATE_PRETRANSITION_SLOPE + POP_GROWTH_MAX_BIRTHRATE) * (1 - malnourishment * (POP_GROWTH_EQUILIBRIUM_SOL - sol)) }
# else if (sol < POP_GROWTH_TRANSITION_SOL)
# { birthrate = sol * POP_GROWTH_BIRTHRATE_PRETRANSITION_SLOPE + POP_GROWTH_MAX_BIRTHRATE }
# else if (sol < POP_GROWTH_STABLE_SOL)
# { birthrate = sol * POP_GROWTH_BIRTHRATE_TRANSITION_SLOPE + POP_GROWTH_BIRTHRATE_TRANSITION_INTERCEPT }
# else { birthrate = POP_GROWTH_MIN_BIRTHRATE }
