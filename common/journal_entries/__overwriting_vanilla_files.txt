## All files which start with a number and do not start with 'br_' are vanilla files
# the purpose of these vanilla files in the mod is to overwrite the base game ones
# multiple things in the files are commented out this is because we don't want them in the mod
# some thing are left uncommented these are because we want them in the mod or because the game try to call them from somewhere else and will give an error if they do not exist
# try if possible to give a reason for why something is commented out or not commented out, to add clearety for if paradox updates the file
