##	These scripted effects have as limitation that they store there result in a local variable (which is stored in the scope of the Country),
##	so this scripted effect can only calculate the percentage of religous folowers per country only once at a time next time it is called it will overwrite the previous result.
##	Also Important is that the result percentage is represented as a value between '0 - 1'

#Calculates the percent of a given countries population that follow a given religion
#This effect takes TARGET_COUNTRY and TARGET_RELIGION as parameters
