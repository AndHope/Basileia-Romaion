HRE Content:
---Overview:
        A strong state in Western Europe which could face turmoil in the distant future, but is set for dominating Europe.
---General Idea:
        -The HRE is the empire formed by Charlemagne, created out of the Frankish Empire and claiming to be the continuation of the Roman Empire. 
        -Still a feudal and corrupt monarchie the empire must be wary of a looming revolution which could, if erupts, 
         overthrow the monarchy and establish a republic or lead the state into anarchy. 
        -But if the HRE manages to reform or suppress the revolution, than it could become stronger than ever.
        -The empire will also have to make a decision about its identity, is it a Roman or French Empire.
        -If it is a Roman Empire then the HRE should try to reestablish its control over the territories of the Western Roman Empire.
