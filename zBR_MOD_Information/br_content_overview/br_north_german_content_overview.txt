North German Content:
---Overview:
        The content here is for all North german states (countries with the culture saxon or baltic).
        But the content is mainly optimised for Saxony.
        Added the north and south german federation as formables (they can be formed thru a journal)
        Added germany as a Major formable
---General Idea:
        -The german states are disunited, In the south they are subjugated by the so called and self-proclamed "Romans", while in the north they are under the yoke of the Danes, Swedes and Poles.
        Only saxony stands as a truly independened german nation. So will Saxony rise to liberate it german brothers and dominate Europe, or will they become a pawn of the surrounding powers
        and become the battlefield of the comming wars.
