###TODO & Content Ideas
#updated 10/21/24

	###Organization
		- reogranize modifiers by catagory/type instead of country. 

	###Balance
	- 1.8 make sure India/Burma population is similar to the 1.7 version I think I lowered it a bit compared to base game but maybe not enough most of the worlds population is lowered by 25-40% compared to base game. 
	- Similarly Nigeria might of been lowered too much double check it.
	

	- Continue tech balance
		- add more diversity to tech pictures
		- make sure all techs have an effect; either buff or building unlock.
		- create more production methods instead of buffs (Do last because it will likely require most time balancing.)
		- add more techs though-out the tree to spread stuff out. Eventually come up with Roman Steam-Punk techs.


	#Indian Ocean trade wars
		- Spice wars in referance to dune 
		- Set up trade wars between the various trade companies operating in india. Might even be cool to have an all out annex war EOC vs DEI balance it so they are nearly even in power winner takes all. 

	###Content

	#HRE
		- HRE-Savoy Journal/Event to expand into Italy. HRE can help facilitate this to grow their subject possibly rename Savoy to Italy once it controls most of North Italy. Possible ERE tie in as they will likely want to limit HRE expansion into Italy.
		- More localizations
		- French identity changes tag for FRA can lead back to a Bonaparte Empire semi liberal constitution. 
		- New flag for Western Roman Republic
		- Rise of Napoleon type figure for FRA or Western Roman Republic

		- Tie more HRE Aggression to their journals. Make it target German and French cultures so it centralizes realm. ( I can make their AI more aggressive to certain tags cultures etc when they have certain JEs. recently added this to the ERE hence why its way better at regaining its breakaway regions.)


		- Create unqiue mechanics for HRE power bloc.
			- Goal would be to make a way to have it replace the vassal with indepdent countries that could not leave the power bloc at least not the way it currently works.

			- Pontics in Pontus/ maybe Black Sea region
				- Identify more on their regional rural hill/mountain identity.

		- Create a chariot racing section similar to the sports in Morganrote

	###Map work

	####Events

		- Look at making collapse events journals civil wars etc late game. 
		- Event chain for when the first ruler of Basileia Romaion dies
			- Make Purple Born added to new rulers if they don't have it.
			- House of the Dragon inspired Scenario With Aurelia and the more progressive elemenets in Greece Proper and a younger son in Anatolia with the conservatives and whichside you pick also gets Konstaintople. 
			- civil war could use elements of usa event chain.
		- Continue working on separatist events make sure they trigger at appropriate and only once per event.
