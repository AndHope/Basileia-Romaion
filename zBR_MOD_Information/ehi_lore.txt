🏺 Imperial Charter Snippet (Chrysobull excerpt)
In Koine-style Medieval Greek:

Ἐν ὀνόματι τοῦ Πατρὸς, καὶ τοῦ Υἱοῦ, καὶ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος.
Χάριτι Θεοῦ, Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων καὶ Αὐτοκράτωρ Ῥωμαίων,
δίδωμι καὶ ἐπιβεβαιοῦμαι ταῖς Ἐμπόραις τοῦ Ἑταιρικοῦ Σώματος
τῆς Ἐμπορικῆς Ἑταιρείας τῆς Ἰνδικῆς,
τὸ προνόμιον τοῦ ἐμπορεύεσθαι, τελωνεῖν,
καὶ ἀποικίζειν κατὰ τοὺς δρόμους τῆς Ἐρυθρᾶς Θαλάσσης
καὶ ἕως Ἰνδικῆς, ὑπὸ σφραγῖδα καὶ γνώρισμα βασιλικὸν.

In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritūs Sanctī.
Per gratiam Dei, Rex Regum et Imperator Romanorum,
concedimus ac confirmamus mercatoribus Societatis Commercialis Indicæ
iura negotiandi, vectigalia colligendi, atque colonias condendi
per vias Maris Rubri usque ad fines Indiæ,
sub sigillo et auctoritate imperiā.

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
By the grace of God, King of Kings and Emperor of the Romans,
I grant and affirm unto the Merchants of the Corporate Body
of the Indian Trade Company
the privilege to trade, levy customs,
and to settle along the routes of the Red Sea
and as far as the lands of India,
under seal and imperial mark.
